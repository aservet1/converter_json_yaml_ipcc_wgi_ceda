# Figure Manager (FM) Metadata Form Script 

This script converts outputs from the metadata form of the Figure Manager (FM) used by the TSU WGI in the context of the AR6 production, in order to meet the requirements for depositing data in the trustworthy CEDA repository (https://www.ceda.ac.uk). 

The input consists of JSON files generated by the FM, containing metadata information provided by the authors and data creators. The output produces YAML files, structured and organized as required by CEDA. Please note that this is an example and not the final version, as it depends on the fields generated by FM and required by CEDA.
