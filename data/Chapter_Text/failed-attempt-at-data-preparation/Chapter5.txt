It is unequivocal that emissions of the well-mixed greenhouse gases
(GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane (CH~4~) and nitrous oxide (N~2~O)
from human activities are the main driver of increases in atmospheric
GHG concentrations since the pre-industrial period. The accumulation of
GHGs in the atmosphere is determined by the balance between
anthropogenic emissions, anthropogenic removals, and
physical-biogeochemical source and sink dynamics on land and in the
ocean. This chapter assesses how physical and biogeochemical processes
of the carbon and nitrogen cycles affect the variability and trends of
GHGs in the atmosphere as well as ocean acidification and deoxygenation.
It identifies physical and biogeochemical feedbacks that have affected
(or could affect) future rates of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere,
and therefore, influence climate change and its impacts. This chapter
also assesses the remaining carbon budget to limit global warming within
various goals, as well as the large-scale consequences of carbon dioxide
removal (CDR) and solar radiation modification (SRM) on biogeochemical
cycles. {Figures 5.1, 5.2}.

**The Human Perturbation of the Carbon and Biogeochemical Cycles**

**Global mean concentrations for well-mixed GHGs (CO~2~, CH~4~ and
N~2~O) in 2019 correspond to increases of about 47%, 156%, and 23%,
respectively, above the levels in 1750 (representative of the
pre-industrial) (*high confidence*).** Current atmospheric
concentrations of the three GHGs are higher than at any point in the
last 800,000 years, and in 2019 reached 409.9 ppm of CO~2~, 1866.3 ppb
of CH~4~, and 332.1 ppb of N~2~O (*very* *high confidence*). Current
CO~2~ concentrations in the atmosphere are also unprecedented in the
last 2 million years (*high confidence*). In the past 60 Myr, there have
been periods in Earth’s history when CO~2~ concentrations were
significantly higher than at present, but multiple lines of evidence
show that the rate at which CO~2~ has increased in the atmosphere during
1900–2019 is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the
last 800,000 years (*high confidence*), and 4–5 times faster than during
the last 56 million years (*low confidence*). {5.1.1, 2.2.3; Figures
5.3, 5.4; Cross-Chapter Box 2.1}

 

**Contemporary Trends of Greenhouse Gases** 

**It is unequivocal that** **the increase of CO~2~, CH~4~, and N~2~O in
the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities
(*very high confidence*).** This assessment is based on multiple lines
of evidence including atmospheric gradients, isotopes, and inventory
data. During the last measured decade, global average annual
anthropogenic emissions of CO~2~, CH~4~, and N~2~O, reached the highest
levels in human history at 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr^–1^ (2010–2019), 335–383 Tg
CH~4~ yr^–1^ (2008–2017), and 4.2–11.4 TgN yr^–1^ (2007–2016),
respectively (*high confidence*). {5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4; Figures
5.6, 5.13, 5.15}.

**The CO~2~ emitted from human activities during the decade of 2010–2019
(decadal average 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr^–1^) was distributed between three
Earth system components: 46% accumulated in the atmosphere (5.1 ± 0.02
PgC yr^–1^), 23% was taken up by the ocean (2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr^–1^) and
31% was stored by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems (3.4 ± 0.9 PgC
yr^–1^) (*high confidence*).** Of the total anthropogenic CO~2~
emissions, the combustion of fossil fuels was responsible for 81–91%,
with the remainder being the net CO~2~ flux from land-use change and
land management (e.g., deforestation, degradation, regrowth after
agricultural abandonment or peat drainage). {5.2.1.2, 5.2.1.5; Table
5.1; Figures 5.5, 5.7, 5.12}

 

**Over the past six decades, the average fraction of anthropogenic CO~2~
emissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere (referred to as the
airborne fraction) has remained nearly constant at approximately 44%.**
The ocean and land sinks of CO~2~ have continued to grow over the past
six decades in response to increasing anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions
(*high confidence)*. Interannual and decadal variability of the regional
and global ocean and land sinks indicate that these sinks are sensitive
to climate conditions and therefore to climate change (*high
confidence*). {5.2.1.1, 5.2.1.3, 5.2.1.4.2; Figures 5.7, 5.8, 5.10}

 

**Recent observations show that ocean carbon processes are starting to
change in response to the growing ocean sink, and these changes are
expected to contribute significantly to future weakening of the ocean
sink under medium- to high-emission scenarios.** However, the effects of
these changes is not yet reflected in a weakening trend of the
contemporary (1960–2019) ocean sink (*high confidence*). {5.1.2,
5.2.1.3, 5.3.2.1; Figures 5.8, 5.20; Cross-Chapter Box 5.3}

**Atmospheric concentration of CH~4~ grew at an average rate of 7.6 ±
2.7 ppb yr^–1^ for the last decade (2010–2019), with a faster growth of
9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr^–1^ over the last six years (2014–2019) (*high
confidence*).** The multi-decadal growth trend in atmospheric CH~4~ is
dominated by anthropogenic activities (*high confidence*), and the
growth since 2007 is largely driven by emissions from both fossil fuels
and agriculture (dominated by livestock) sectors (*medium confidence)*.
The interannual variability is dominated by El Niño–Southern Oscillation
cycles, during which biomass burning and wetland emissions, as well as
loss by reaction with tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) play an
important role. {5.2.2; Figures 5.13, 5.14; Table 5.2; Cross-Chapter Box
5.2}

 

**Atmospheric concentration of N~2~O grew at an average rate of 0.85 ±
0.03 ppb yr^–1^ between 1995 and 2019, with a further increase to 0.95 ±
0.04 ppb yr^–1^ in the most recent decade (2010–2019).** This increase
is dominated by anthropogenic emissions, which have increased by 30%
between the 1980s and the most recent observational decade (2007–2016)
(*high confidence*). Increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and manure
contributed to about two-thirds of the increase during the 1980–2016
period, with the fossil fuels/industry, biomass burning, and wastewater
accounting for much of the rest (*high confidence*). {5.2.3; Figures
5.15, 5.16, 5.17}

 

**Ocean Acidification and Ocean Deoxygenation**

 

**Ocean acidification is strengthening as a result of the ocean
continuing to take up CO~2~ from human-caused emissions (*very high
confidence*).** This CO~2~ uptake is driving changes in seawater
chemistry that result in the decrease of pH and associated reductions in
the saturation state of calcium carbonate, which is a constituent of
skeletons or shells of a variety of marine organisms. These trends of
ocean acidification are becoming clearer globally, with a *very likely*
rate of decrease in pH in the ocean surface layer of 0.016 to 0.020 per
decade in the subtropics and 0.002 to 0.026 per decade in subpolar and
polar zones since the 1980s. Ocean acidification has spread deeper in
the ocean, surpassing 2000 m depth in the northern North Atlantic and in
the Southern Ocean. The greater projected pH declines in Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are primarily a
consequence of higher atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations in the Shared
Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios than their Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)-RCP analogues {5.3.2.2, 5.3.3.1;
5.3.4.1; Figures 5.20, 5.21} 

 

**Ocean deoxygenation is projected to continue to increase with ocean
warming (*high confidence*).** Earth system models (ESMs) project a
32–71% greater subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline, depending on the
scenario, than reported in the Special Report on the Ocean and
Cryosphere (SROCC) for the period 2080–2099. This is attributed to the
effect of larger surface warming in CMIP6 models, which increases ocean
stratification and reduces ventilation (*medium confidence*). There is
*low confidence* in the projected reduction of oceanic N~2~O emissions
under high-emission scenarios because of greater oxygen losses simulated
in ESMs in CMIP6, uncertainties in the process of oceanic N~2~O
emissions, and a limited number of modelling studies available {5.3.3.2;
7.5}.

 

**Future Projections of Carbon Feedbacks on Climate Change**

 

**Oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow
with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO~2~, but the fraction of
emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO~2~
concentration increases (*high confidence*).** ESMs suggest
approximately equal global land and ocean carbon uptake for each of the
SSPs scenarios. However, the range of model projections is much larger
for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide range of model responses,
uncertainty in atmospheric CO~2~ by 2100 is dominated by future
anthropogenic emissions rather than uncertainties related to
carbon–climate feedbacks (*high confidence*). {5.4.5; Figure 5.25, 5.26}

**Increases in atmospheric CO~2~ lead to increases in land carbon
storage through CO~2~ fertilization of photosynthesis and increased
water use efficiency (*high confidence*).** However, the overall change
in land carbon also depends on land-use change and on the response of
vegetation and soil to continued warming and changes in the water cycle,
including increased droughts in some regions that will diminish the sink
capacity. Climate change alone is expected to increase land carbon
accumulation in the high latitudes (not including permafrost), but also
to lead to a counteracting loss of land carbon in the tropics (*medium
confidence*, Figure 5.25). More than half of the latest CMIP6 ESMs
include nutrient limitations on the carbon cycle, but these models still
project increasing tropical land carbon (*medium confidence*) and
increasing global land carbon (*high confidence*) through the 21st
century. {5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.5; Figure 5.27; Cross-Chapter Box 5.1}

 

**Future trajectories of the ocean CO~2~ sink are strongly
emissions-scenario dependent (*high confidence*).** Emission scenarios
SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 lead to warming of the surface ocean and large
reductions of the buffering capacity, which will slow the growth of the
ocean sink after 2050. Scenario SSP1-2.6 limits further reductions in
buffering capacity and warming, and the ocean sink weakens in response
to the declining rate of increasing atmospheric CO~2~. There is *low
confidence* in how changes in the biological pump will influence the
magnitude and direction of the ocean carbon feedback. {5.4.2, 5.4.4,
Cross-Chapter Box 5.3}

**Beyond 2100, land and ocean may transition from being a carbon sink to
a source under either very high emissions or net negative emissions
scenarios, but for different reasons.** Under very high emissions
scenarios such as SSP5-8.5, ecosystem carbon losses due to warming lead
the land to transition from a carbon sink to a source (*medium
confidence*), while the ocean is expected to remain a sink (*high
confidence*). For scenarios in which CO~2~ concentration stabilizes,
land and ocean carbon sinks gradually take up less carbon as the
increase in atmospheric CO~2~ slows down. In scenarios with moderate net
negative CO~2~ emissions, and CO~2~ concentrations declining during the
21st century (e.g., SSP1-2.6), the land sink transitions to a net source
in decades to a few centuries after CO~2~ emissions become net negative,
while the ocean remains a sink (*low confidence*). Under scenarios with
large net negative CO~2~ emissions and rapidly declining CO~2~
concentrations (e.g., SSP5-3.4-OS (overshoot)), both land and ocean
switch from a sink to a transient source during the overshoot period
(*medium confidence*). {5.4.10, 5.6.2.1.2; Figures 5.30, 5.33}

**Thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release (*high
confidence*), but there is *low confidence* in the timing, magnitude and
the relative roles of CO~2~ versus CH~4~ as feedback processes**. CO~2~
release from permafrost is projected to be 3–41 PgC per 1ºC of global
warming by 2100, based on an ensemble of models. However, the incomplete
representation of important processes such as abrupt thaw, combined with
weak observational constraints, only allow *low confidence* in both the
magnitude of these estimates and in how linearly proportional this
feedback is to the amount of global warming. It is *very unlikely* that
gas clathrates in terrestrial and subsea permafrost will lead to a
detectable departure from the emissions trajectory during this century.
{5.4.9; Box 5.1}

**The net response of natural CH~4~ and N~2~O sources to future warming
will be increased emissions (*medium confidence*).** Key processes
include increased CH~4~ emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, as
well as increased soil N~2~O emissions in a warmer climate, while ocean
N~2~O emissions are projected to decline at centennial time scale. The
magnitude of the responses of each individual process and how linearly
proportional these feedbacks are to the amount of global warming is
known with *low confidence* due to incomplete representation of
important processes in models combined with weak observational
constraints. Models project that, over the 21st century, the combined
feedback of 0.02–0.09 W m^–2^ °C^–1^ is comparable to the effect of a
CO~2~ release of 5–18 PgCeq °C^–1^ (*low confidence*). {5.4.7, 5.4.8;
Figure 5.29}

**The response of biogeochemical cycles to the anthropogenic
perturbation can be abrupt at regional scales, and irreversible on
decadal to century time scales (*high confidence*).** The probability of
crossing uncertain regional thresholds (e.g., high severity fires,
forest dieback) increases with climate change (*high confidence*).
Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in biogeochemical cycles lead
to additional uncertainty in 21st century GHG concentrations, but these
are *very likely* to be smaller than the uncertainty associated with
future anthropogenic emissions (*high confidence*). {5.4.9}

  

**Remaining Carbon Budgets to Climate Stabilization**

**There is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO~2~ emissions
and the increase in global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) caused by
CO~2~ over the course of this century for global warming levels up to at
least 2°C relative to pre-industrial (*high confidence*).** Halting
global warming would thus require global net anthropogenic CO~2~
emissions to become zero. The ratio between cumulative CO~2~ emissions
and the consequent GSAT increase, which is called the transient climate
response to cumulative emissions of CO~2~ (TCRE), *likely* falls in the
1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 PgC range. The narrowing of this range compared to
AR5 is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in
this assessment. Beyond this century, there is *low confidence* that the
TCRE remains an accurate predictor of temperature changes in scenarios
of very low or net negative CO~2~ emissions because of uncertain Earth
system feedbacks that can result in further warming or a path-dependency
of warming as a function of cumulative CO~2~ emissions. {5.4, 5.5.1}

 

**Mitigation requirements over this century for limiting maximum warming
to specific levels can be quantified using a carbon budget that relates
cumulative CO~2~ emissions to global mean temperature increase (*high
confidence*).** For the period 1850–2019, a total of 655 ± 65 PgC (2390
± 240 GtCO~2~) of anthropogenic CO~2~ has been emitted. Remaining carbon
budgets (starting from 1 January 2020) for limiting warming to 1.5°C,
1.7°C, and 2.0°C are 140 PgC (500 GtCO~2~), 230 PgC (850 GtCO~2~) and
370 PgC (1350 GtCO~2~), respectively, based on the 50th percentile of
TCRE. For the 67th percentile, the respective values are 110 PgC (400
GtCO~2~), 190 PgC (700 GtCO~2~) and 310 PgC (1150 GtCO~2~). These
remaining carbon budgets may vary by an estimated ± 60 PgC (220 GtCO~2~)
depending on how successfully future non-CO~2~ emissions can be reduced.
Since AR5 and SR1.5, estimates have undergone methodological
improvements, resulting in larger, yet consistent estimates. {5.5.2,
5.6; Figure 5.31; Table 5.8}

 

**Several factors affect the precise value of remaining carbon budgets,
including estimates of historical warming, future emissions from thawing
permafrost, and variations in projected non-CO~2~ warming.** Remaining
carbon budget estimates can increase or decrease by 150 PgC (550
GtCO~2~, *likely* range) due to uncertainties in the level of historical
warming, and by an additional ± 60 PgC (±220 GtCO, *likely* range) due
to geophysical uncertainties surrounding the climate response to
non-CO~2~ emissions such as CH~4~, N~2~O, and aerosols. Permafrost thaw
is included in the estimates, together with other feedbacks that are
often not captured by models. Despite the large uncertainties
surrounding the quantification of the effects of additional Earth system
feedback processes, such as emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw,
these feedbacks represent identified additional amplifying risk factors
that scale with additional warming and mostly increase the challenge of
limiting warming to specific temperature thresholds. These uncertainties
do not change the basic conclusion that global CO~2~ emissions would
need to decline to at least net zero to halt global warming. {5.4,
5.5.2} 

**Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar
Radiation Modification**

**Land- and ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods have the
potential to sequester CO~2~ from the atmosphere, but the benefits of
this removal would be partially offset by CO~2~ release from land and
ocean carbon stores (*very* *high confidence*).** The fraction of CO~2~
removed that remains out of the atmosphere, a measure of CDR
effectiveness, decreases slightly with increasing amount of removal
(*medium confidence*) and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower
CO~2~ concentrations (*medium confidence*). {5.6.2.1; Figures 5.32,
5.33, 5.34}

**The century-scale climate–carbon cycle response to a CO~2~ removal
from the atmosphere is not always equal and opposite to the response to
a CO~2~ emission (*medium confidence*).** For simultaneously cumulative
CO~2~ emissions and removals of greater than or equal to 100 PgC, CO~2~
emissions are 4 ± 3% more effective at raising atmospheric CO~2~ than
CO~2~ removals are at lowering atmospheric CO~2~. The asymmetry
originates from state-dependencies and non-linearities in carbon cycle
processes and implies that an extra amount of CDR is required to
compensate for a positive emission of a given magnitude to attain the
same change in atmospheric CO~2~. The net effect of this asymmetry on
the global surface temperature is poorly constrained due to *low
agreement* between models (*low confidence*). {5.6.2.1; Figure 5.35}

**Wide-ranging side** **effects of CDR methods have been identified that
can either weaken or strengthen the carbon sequestration and cooling
potential of these methods and affect the achievement of sustainable
development goals (*high confidence*).** Biophysical and biogeochemical
side effects of CDR methods are associated with changes in surface
albedo, the water cycle, emissions of CH~4~ and N~2~O, ocean
acidification and marine ecosystem productivity (*high confidence*).
These side effects and associated Earth system feedbacks can decrease
carbon uptake and/or change local and regional climate, and in turn
limit the CO~2~ sequestration and cooling potential of specific CDR
methods (*medium confidence*). Deployment of CDR, particularly on land,
can also affect water quality and quantity, food production and
biodiversity, with consequences for the achievement of related
sustainable development goals (*high confidence*). These effects are
often highly dependent on local context, management regime, prior land
use, and scale of deployment (*high confidence*). A wide range of
co-benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore natural
ecosystems or improve soil carbon (*high confidence*). The
biogeochemical effects of terminating CDR are expected to be small for
most CDR methods (*medium confidence*). {5.6.2.2; Figure 5.36;
Cross-Chapter Box 5.1}

** **

**Solar radiation modification (SRM) would increase the global land and
ocean CO~2~ sinks (*medium confidence*) but would not stop CO~2~ from
increasing in the atmosphere, thus exacerbating ocean acidification
under continued anthropogenic emissions (*high confidence*).** SRM acts
to cool the planet relative to unmitigated climate change, which would
increase the land sink by reducing plant and soil respiration and slow
the reduction of ocean carbon uptake due to warming (*medium
confidence*). SRM would not counteract or stop ocean acidification
(*high confidence*). The sudden and sustained termination of SRM would
rapidly increase global warming, with the return of positive and
negative effects on the carbon sinks (*very* *high confidence*) {4.6.3;
5.6.3}

Introduction  {#introduction .AR6Chap5Level151}
-------------

The physical and biogeochemical controls of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a
central motivation for this chapter, which identifies biogeochemical
feedbacks that have led or could lead to a future acceleration, slowdown
or abrupt transitions in the rate of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere,
and therefore of climate change. A characterization of the trends and
feedbacks lead to improved quantification for the remaining carbon
budgets for climate stabilization, and the responses of the carbon cycle
to atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which is embedded in many
of the mitigation scenarios, to achieve the goals of the Paris
Agreement.

Changes in the abundance of well-mixed GHGs – carbon dioxide (CO~2~),
methane (CH~4~) and nitrous oxide (N~2~O) – in the atmosphere play a
large role in determining the Earth’s radiative properties and its
climate in the past, the present and the future (Chapters 2, 4, 6 and
7). Since 1950, the increase in atmospheric GHGs has been the dominant
cause of the human-induced climate change (Section 3.3). While the main
driver of changes in atmospheric GHGs over the past 200 years relates to
the direct emissions from human activities, the net accumulation of GHGs
in the atmosphere is controlled by biogeochemical source-sink dynamics
of carbon that exchange between multiple reservoirs on land, oceans and
atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change for the
period 1750–2019 have released an estimated 700 ± 75 PgC (1 PgC = 10^15^
g of carbon) into the atmosphere, of which less than half remains in the
atmosphere today (Sections 5.2.1.2; 5.2.1.5) (Friedlingstein et al.,
2020). This emphasizes the central role of terrestrial and ocean CO~2~
sinks in regulating its atmospheric concentration (Ballantyne et al.,
2012; W. Li et al., 2016; Le Quéré et al., 2018a; Ciais et al., 2019;
Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

The chapter covers three dominant GHGs in the human perturbation of the
Earth’s radiation budget for which high-quality records exist: CO~2~,
CH~4~ and N~2~O (Figure 5.1).

Section 5.1 (this section) provides the time context on how unique
current and future scenarios of GHGs atmospheric concentrations and
growth rates are in the Earth’s history. It also introduces the main
processes involved in carbon–climate feedbacks, followed by an
assessment of what can be learned from the paleo record towards a better
understanding of contemporary and future GHGs–climate dynamics and their
response to different mitigation trajectories.

Section 5.2 covers the state of the carbon cycle and other
biogeochemical cycles, and global budgets of CO~2~, CH~4~ and N~2~O for
the industrial era (since 1750). The section emphasizes the last 60-year
period for which high-resolution observations are available and the most
recent decade for comprehensive GHG budgets. Significant advances have
taken place since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), particularly
in constraining the annual-to-decadal variability of the ocean and land
carbon sources and sinks, and in revealing the sensitivity of carbon
pools to current and future climate changes. There has been an important
increase in modelling capability of the three GHGs, for land and oceans,
atmospheric and ocean observations, and remote sensing products that
have enabled researchers to constrain the causes of the observed trends
and variability.

Section 5.3 builds on Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere (SROCC)
covering the change in ocean acidification due to oceanic CO~2~ uptake
across the paleo, historical periods and future projections using
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), with consequences
for marine life (assessed in the Sixth Assessment Report Working Group
II, AR6 WGII) and biogeochemical cycles. The section also assesses
changes in deoxygenation of the oceans due to warming, increased
stratification of the surface ocean, and slowing of the meridional
overturning circulation.

Section 5.4 covers the future projections of biogeochemical cycles and
their feedbacks to the climate system fully utilizing the database of
the concentration-driven CMIP6. Since AR5, Earth system models (ESMs)
have made progress towards including more complex carbon cycle and
associated biogeochemical processes that enable exploring a range of
possible future carbon–climate feedbacks and their influences on the
climate system. The section addresses uncertainties and limits of our
models to predict future dynamics for GHG emissions trajectories, as
well as new understanding on processes involved in carbon–climate
feedbacks and the possibility for rapid and abrupt changes brought by
non-linear dynamics.

Section 5.5 covers the development of the total and remaining carbon
budgets to climate stabilization targets and the associated transient
climate response to cumulative CO~2~ emissions. The section shows the
progress made since AR5 (IPCC, 2013a) and the Special Report on Global
Warming of 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018a), particularly on key components required
to estimate the remaining carbon budget, including the transient
response to cumulative emissions of CO~2~, the zero emissions
commitment, the projected non-CO~2~ warming, and the unrepresented Earth
system feedbacks.

Section 5.6 assesses the impacts of CDR and solar radiation modification
for the purpose of climate mitigation on the global carbon cycle,
building from the assessment in the IPCC Special Report on Climate
Change and Land (SRCCL). It includes an overview of the major CDR
options and potential collateral biogeochemical effects beyond the
intended climate mitigation strategies. The potential capacity to
deliver atmospheric reductions and the socio-economic feasibility of
such options are assessed in detail in AR6 working group III (WGIII).

Finally, Section 5.7 highlights the current knowledge gaps which, if
filled, would strengthen this assessment.

### The Physical and Biogeochemical Processes in Carbon–Climate feedbacks {#the-physical-and-biogeochemical-processes-in-carbonclimate-feedbacks .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The influence of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions and emission scenarios on
the carbon–climate system is the primarily driver of ocean and
terrestrial sinks as the major negative feedbacks (β) that determine the
atmospheric CO~2~ levels, and then drive climate feedbacks through
radiative forcing (γ) (Figure 5.2) (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; C.D.
Jones et al., 2013; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Biogeochemical
feedbacks are an outcome of carbon and climate forcing the physics and
the biogeochemical processes of the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycles
(Figure 5.2) (Katavouta et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019; Jones and
Friedlingstein, 2020). Together, these carbon–climate feedbacks can
amplify or suppress climate change by altering the rate at which CO~2~
builds up in the atmosphere through changes in the land and ocean
sources and sinks (Figure 5.2; C.D. Jones et al., 2013; Raupach et al.,
2014; Williams et al., 2019). These changes depend on the, often
non-linear, interaction of the drivers (CO~2~ and climate) and processes
in the ocean and land as well as the emission scenarios (Figure 5.2;
Sections 5.4 and 5.6) (Raupach et al., 2014; Schwinger et al., 2014;
Williams et al., 2019). There is *high* *confidence* that carbon–climate
feedbacks and their century scale evolution play a critical role in two
linked climate metrics that have significant climate and policy
implications: (i) the fraction of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions that
remains in the atmosphere, the so-called airborne fraction of CO~2~ (AF;
Section 5.2.1.2, Figures 5.2 and 5.7, and FAQ 5.1); and (ii) the
quasi-linear trend characteristic of the transient temperature response
to cumulative CO~2~ emissions (TCRE; Section 5.5; MacDougall, 2016;
Williams et al., 2016; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) and other GHGs
(CH~4~ and N~2~O). This chapter assesses the implications of these
issues from the perspective of carbon cycle processes (Figure 5.2) in
Section 5.2 (historical and contemporary), Section 5.3 (changing
carbonate chemistry), Section 5.4 (future projections), Section 5.5
(remaining carbon budget) and Section 5.6 (response to carbon dioxide
removal and solar radiation modification).

The airborne fraction is an important constraint for adjustments in
carbon–climate feedbacks and reflects the partitioning of CO~2~
emissions between reservoirs by the negative feedbacks, which were 31%
on land and 23% in the ocean for the decade 2010–2019, and also
dominated the historical period (Figure 5.2; Table 5.1) (Friedlingstein
et al., 2020). During the period 1959–2019, the airborne fraction has
largely followed the growth in anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions with a mean
of 44% and a large interannual variability (Ballantyne et al., 2012;
Ciais et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020) (Section 5.2.1.2; Table
5.1). The negative feedback to CO~2~ concentrations is associated with
its impact on the air–sea and air–land CO~2~ exchange through
strengthening of partial pressure of CO~2~ (pCO~2~) gradients as well as
the internal processes that enhance uptake. Two of these key processes
are the buffering capacity of the ocean and the CO~2~ fertilization
effect on gross primary production (Sections 5.4.1–5.4.4).

Positive and negative climate and carbon feedbacks involve: (i) fast
processes on land and oceans at time scales from minutes to years, such
as photosynthesis, soil respiration, net primary production, shallow
ocean physics and air–sea fluxes; and (ii) slower processes taking from
decades to millennia, such as changing ocean buffering capacity, ocean
ventilation, vegetation dynamics, permafrost changes, peat formation and
decomposition (Figure 5.2; Ciais et al., 2013; Forzieri et al., 2017;
Williams et al., 2019). Depending on the particular combination of
driver process and response dynamics, they behave as positive or
negative feedbacks that amplify or dampen the magnitude and rates of
climate change, respectively (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et al.,
2003, 2006; Hauck and Völker, 2015; Williams et al., 2019); red and
turquoise arrows in Figure 5.2 and Table 5.1).

Carbon cycle feedbacks co-exist with climate (heat and moisture)
feedbacks (Cross-Chapter Boxes 5.1 and 5.3), which together drive
contemporary (Section 5.2) and future (Section 5.4) carbon–climate
feedbacks (Williams et al., 2019). The excess heat generated by
radiative forcing from increasing concentration of atmospheric CO~2~ and
other GHGs is mostly taken up by the ocean (&gt;90%) and the residual
balance partitioned between atmospheric, terrestrial and ice melting
(Cross-Chapter Box 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015). The combined effect of
these two large-scale negative feedbacks of CO~2~ and heat are reflected
in the TCRE (Section 5.5 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3), which points to a
quasi-linear and quasi-emission-path independent relationship between
cumulative emissions of CO~2~ and global warming, which is used as the
basis to estimate the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5; MacDougall
and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 2017; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020;
Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). There is still *low confidence* on the
relative roles and importance of the ocean and terrestrial carbon
processes on TCRE variability and uncertainty on centennial time scales
(MacDougall, 2016; MacDougall et al., 2017; N.L. Williams et al., 2017;
Katavouta et al., 2018, 2019; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) (Sections
5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.2).

**\[START FIGURE 5.2 HERE\] **

1.  **Key compartments, processes and pathways that govern historical
    and future CO~2~ concentrations and carbon–climate feedbacks through
    the coupled Earth system.** The anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions,
    including land use change, are partitioned via negative feedbacks
    (turquoise dotted arrows) between the ocean (23%), the land (31%)
    and the airborne fraction (46%) of anthropogenic CO~2~ that sets the
    changing CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere (2010–2019, Table
    5.1). This regulates most of the radiative forcing that creates the
    heat imbalance that drives the climate feedbacks to the ocean (blue)
    and land (green). Positive feedbacks (red arrows) result from
    processes in the ocean and on land (red text). Positive feedbacks
    are influenced by both carbon-concentration and carbon–climate
    feedbacks simultaneously. Additional biosphere processes have been
    included but these have an as yet uncertain feedback impact
    (blue-dotted arrows). CO~2~ removal from the atmosphere into the
    ocean, land and geological reservoirs, necessary for negative
    emissions, has been included (grey arrows). Although this schematic
    is built around CO~2~, the dominant GHG, some of the same processes
    also influence the fluxes of CH~4~ and N~2~O and the strength of the
    positive feedbacks from the terrestrial and ocean systems.

**\[END FIGURE 5.2 HERE\] **

The combined effects of climate and CO~2~ concentration feedbacks on the
global carbon cycle are projected by ESMs to modify both the processes
and natural reservoirs of carbon on a regional and global scale that may
result in positive feedbacks (red arrows in Figure 5.2), which could
weaken the major terrestrial and ocean sinks and disrupt the airborne
fraction and TCRE under medium- to high-emission scenarios (Section
5.4.5 and Figure 5.25).

### Paleo Trends and Feedbacks {#paleo-trends-and-feedbacks .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Paleoclimatic proxy records extend beyond the variability of recent
decadal climate oscillations and thus provide an independent perspective
on feedbacks between climate and carbon cycle dynamics. According to
reconstructions, these past changes were slower than the current
anthropogenic ones, so they cannot provide an unequivocal comparison.
Nonetheless, they can help appraise sensitivities and point towards
potentially dominant mechanisms of change (Tierney et al., 2020) on
(sub)centennial to (multi)millennial time scales.

The AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) concluded with *medium* *confidence* that
atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations reached 350–450 ppm during the
mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), and possibly 1000 ppm during the Early Eocene
(52–48 Ma). The AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) also concluded with *very high
confidence* that the current rise in the atmospheric concentrations of
CO~2~, CH~4~ and N~2~O were unprecedented with respect to the ice core
record covering the last deglacial transition (LDT, 18–11 ka) and with
*medium confidence* that the rate of change of the reconstructed GHG
rise was also unprecedented compared to the lower resolution of the
records of the past 800 kyr.

1.  []{#_Toc70535645 .anchor}Cenozoic Proxy CO~2~ Record

Quantifying past changes in the rate of CO~2~ accumulation in the
atmosphere based on reconstructions using marine sediment proxies is
complex as age model uncertainties, assumptions and shortcomings
underlying proxy applications and sedimentary processes conspire to
alter and confound rate estimates (Ajayi et al., 2020). Differential
sediment mixing and bioturbation contribute to smooth and attenuate
proxy records (Hupp and Kelly, 2020), thereby tending to underestimate
maximum rates of change (Kemp et al., 2015). Considering the extent to
which uncertainties can affect sediment-based rate estimates, and
notwithstanding recent effort in minimizing their inherent contribution,
there is generally *low to medium confidence* in quantifying rates of
change on a time scale less than a decade back thousands of years, and
less than a millennium back millions of years in the past based on
marine sediments.

In the past, atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations reached much higher levels
than present day (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and Figure 5.3). In particular,
the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), 55.9–55.7 Ma (Figure 5.3),
provides some level of comparison with the current and projected
anthropogenic increase in CO~2~ emissions (Chapter 2). Atmospheric CO~2~
concentrations increased from about 900 to around 2000 ppm in 3–20 kyr
as a result of geological carbon release to the ocean–atmosphere system
[]{#_Hlk74835800 .anchor}(Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui
and Schubert, 2018; Kirtland Turner, 2018). There is *low* to *medium
confidence* in evaluations of the total amount of carbon released during
the PETM, as proxy data constrained estimates vary from around 3000 to
more than 7000 PgC, with methane hydrates, volcanic emissions,
terrestrial and/or marine organic carbon, or some combination thereof,
as the probable sources of carbon (Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011;
Gutjahr et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2019; Elling et
al., 2020; Haynes and Hönisch, 2020). Methane emissions related to
hydrate/permafrost thawing and fossil carbon oxidation may have acted as
positive feedbacks (Lunt et al., 2011; Armstrong McKay and Lenton, 2018;
Lyons et al., 2019), as the inferred increase in atmospheric CO~2~ can
only account for approximately half of the reported warming (Zeebe et
al., 2009). The estimated, time-integrated carbon input is broadly
similar to the RCP8.5 extension scenario, although CO~2~ emission rates
(0.3–1.5 Pg yr^–1^) and by inference the rate of CO~2~ accumulation in
the atmosphere (4–42 ppm per century) during the PETM were at least 4–5
lower than during the modern era (from 1995 to 2014; Table 2.1; Zeebe et
al., 2016; Gingerich, 2019).

The last 50 Myr (50 million years) have been characterized by a gradual
decline in atmospheric CO~2~ levels at a rate of about 16 ppm Myr^–1^
(Figure 5.3; Foster et al., 2017; Gutjahr et al., 2017). The exact cause
of this long-term change in CO~2~ remains uncertain, but may be related
to an imbalance between long-term sources of CO~2~ (volcanic outgassing)
and long-term sinks (organic carbon burial and silicate weathering).

The most recent time interval when atmospheric CO~2~ concentration was
as high as 1000 ppm (i.e., similar to the end of 21st century projection
for the high-end emission scenario RCP8.5) was around 33.5 Ma, prior to
the Eocene-Oligocene transition (Y.G. Zhang et al., 2013; Anagnostou et
al., 2016). Atmospheric CO~2~ levels then reached a critical threshold
(1000–750 ppm; DeConto et al., 2008) to allow for the development of
permanent regional ice sheets on Antarctica, associated with changes in
Southern Ocean hydrography, which would have increased deep ocean CO~2~
storage (Leutert et al., 2020).

The most recent interval characterized by atmospheric CO~2~ levels
similar to modern (i.e., 360–420 ppm) was the mid-Pliocene Warm Period
(MPWP, 3.3–3.0 Myr; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; de la Vega et al.,
2020) (Chapter 2). The relatively high atmospheric CO~2~ concentration
during the MPWP are related to vigorous ocean circulation and a rather
inefficient marine biological carbon pump (Burls et al., 2017), which
would have reduced deep ocean carbon storage. After the MPWP,
atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations declined gradually at a rate of 30 ppm
Myr^–1^ (Figure 5.3; de la Vega et al., 2020), as an increase in ocean
stratification led to enhanced ocean carbon storage, allowing for major,
sustained advances in northern hemisphere ice sheets, 2.7 Ma (Sigman et
al., 2004; DeConto et al., 2008).

1.  []{#_Toc70535646 .anchor}Glacial–Interglacial Greenhouse Gas Records

The Antarctic ice core record covering the past 800 kyr provides an
important archive to explore the carbon–climate feedbacks prior to
anthropogenic perturbations (Brovkin et al., 2016). Polar ice cores
represent the only climatic archive from which past GHG concentrations
can be directly measured. Major GHGs, CH~4~, N~2~O and CO~2~ generally
co-vary on orbital time scales (Loulergue et al., 2008; Lüthi et al.,
2008; Schilt et al., 2010b; Chapter 2), with consistently higher
atmospheric concentrations during warm intervals of the past, pointing
to a strong sensitivity to climate (Figure 5.4). Modelling work suggests
that the carbon cycle contributed to globalise and amplify changes in
orbital forcing, which are pacing glacial–interglacial climate
oscillations (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017), with ocean biogeochemistry
and physics, terrestrial vegetation, peatland, permafrost and exchanges
with the lithosphere including chemical weathering, volcanic activity,
sediment burial and marine calcium carbonate compensation all playing a
role in modulating the concentration of atmospheric GHGs.

Since AR5, the number of ice core records and the temporal resolution of
their data for the last 800 kyr have improved, in particular for the
last 60 kyr. Additionally, the advent of isotopic measurements on GHGs
extracted from air trapped in ice, allows for more robust source
apportionments and inventory assessments. Therefore, the ensuing
discussion focuses on these two specific aspects.

Major pre-industrial sources of CH~4~ comprise wetlands (including
subglacial environments) and biomass burning (Bock et al., 2010, 2017;
Lamarche-Gagnon et al., 2019; Kleinen et al., 2020). Pre-industrial
atmospheric N~2~O concentrations were regulated by microbial production
in marine and terrestrial environments and by photochemical removal in
the stratosphere (Schilt et al., 2014; Battaglia and Joos, 2018; Fischer
et al., 2019). Pre-industrial atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations were
largely regulated by exchange with exogenic terrestrial and ocean carbon
reservoirs. The imbalance between geological sources and sinks in the
ocean–atmosphere–land biosphere system additionally plays an important
role in modulating the air-sea partitioning of the active carbon
inventory on multi-millennial time scales (Cartapanis et al., 2018).

    Siegenthaler et al., 2005; Loulergue et al., 2008; Lüthi et al.,

    from Law Dome ice core analysis (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006). The
    surface observations for all species are taken from NOAA cooperative

**\[END FIGURE 5.4 HERE\] **

Model-based estimates indicate that wetland CH~4~ emissions were reduced
by 24–40% during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to
pre-industrial, while CH~4~ emissions related to biomass burning
(wildfires) decreased by 35–75% (Valdes et al., 2005; Hopcroft et al.,
2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). N~2~O emissions decreased by about 30%
during the LGM based on data-constrained model estimates (Schilt et al.,
2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019) owing to a combination of a weaker
hydrological cycle and a generally better ventilated intermediate depth
ocean relative to present, reducing (de)nitrification processes
(Galbraith and Kienast, 2013; H. Fischer et al., 2019).

During past ice ages, generally colder and drier climate conditions
contributed to a substantial decline of the land biosphere carbon
inventory, in particular in boreal peatlands (–300 PgC; Treat et al.,
2019). Estimates assessing the glacial decrease in the global
terrestrial biosphere carbon stock vary between –300 and –600 PgC (Ciais
et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2014; Menviel et al., 2017; Kleinen et
al., 2020), possibly –850 PgC when accounting for ocean-sediment
interactions and burial (Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019), a considerable
contraction when compared to the modern land biosphere stock. The large
range of estimates reflects a yet limited understanding of how carbon
cycle dynamics were altered by glacially perturbed nutrient fluxes and
soil dynamics, as well as largely exposed shelf areas in the tropics as
a result of lowered sea level. Recent estimates suggest deep-sea CO~2~
storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 750
– 950 PgC (Skinner et al., 2015; Buchanan et al., 2016; Skinner et al.,
2017; Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2020). A combination of
increased CO~2~ solubility associated with 2–3°C lower mean oceanic
temperatures (Bereiter et al., 2018), increased the oceanic residence
time of CO~2~ (Skinner et al., 2017), altered oceanic alkalinity (Yu et
al., 2010a; Cartapanis et al., 2018). A generally more efficient marine
biological carbon pump (BCP; Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Yu et al.,
2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020) enhanced the partition CO~2~ into the
ocean interior, (although the relative contribution of each mechanism
remains a matter of debate). Recent observationally constrained ESM
results highlight that air-sea disequilibrium amplifies the effect of
cooling and iron fertilization on glacial carbon storage (Khatiwala et
al., 2019).

Ice core observations combined with model-based estimates thus reveal
with *high confidence* that both terrestrial and marine CH~4~ and N~2~O
emissions were reduced under glacial climate conditions. Multiple lines
of evidence indicate with *high confidence* that enhanced storage of
remineralized CO~2~ in the ocean interior, owing to a combination of
synergistic mechanisms, was sufficient to balance the removal of carbon
from the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined
during the last ice age.

Vegetation regrowth and increased precipitation in wetland regions
associated with the mid-deglacial Northern Hemisphere warming (referred
to as the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) warm interval, 14.7–12.7 ka), in
particular in the (sub)tropics, accounts for large increases in both
CH~4~ and N~2~O emissions to the atmosphere (Schilt et al., 2014;
Baumgartner et al., 2014; Bock et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2019).
Specifically, changes in CH~4~ sources were steered by variations in
vegetation productivity, source size area, temperatures and
precipitation as modulated by insolation, local sea level changes and
monsoon intensity (Bock et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). Changes in
the CH~4~ atmospheric sink term probably only played a secondary role in
modulating atmospheric CH~4~ inventories across the LDT (Hopcroft et
al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020) Geological emissions, related to the
destabilization of fossil (radiocarbon-dead) CH~4~ sources buried in
continental margins as a result of sudden warming, appear small (Bock et
al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). Stable
isotope analysis on N~2~O extracted from Antarctic and Greenland ice
reveal that marine and terrestrial emissions increased by 0.7 ± 0.3 and
1.7 ± 0.3 TgN, respectively, across the LDT (H. Fischer et al., 2019).
During abrupt Northern Hemisphere warmings, terrestrial emissions
responded rapidly to the northward displacement of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with the resumption of the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; H. Fischer et al., 2019).
About 90% of these step increases occurred rapidly, possibly in less
than 200 years (H. Fischer et al., 2019). In contrast, marine emissions
increased more gradually, modulated by global ocean circulation
reorganization.

The gradual increase in atmospheric CO~2~ across the LDT was punctuated
by three centennial 10–13 ppm increments, coeval with 100–200 ppb
increases in CH~4~ (Marcott et al., 2014), reminiscent of similar
oscillations reported for the last ice age associated with transient
warming events (Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) events; Ahn and Brook, 2014;
Rhodes et al., 2017; Bauska et al., 2018) as well as previous deglacial
transitions (Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). The rate of change in
atmospheric CO~2~ accumulation during these transient events exceeds the
averaged deglacial growth rates by at least 50% (Table 2.1, Figure 5.4).
The early deglacial release of remineralized carbon from the ocean abyss
coincided with the resumption of Southern Ocean overturning circulation
(Skinner et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2014;
Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; Jaccard et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018;
Moy et al., 2019) and the concomitant reduction in the global efficiency
of the marine BCP, associated, in part, with dwindling iron
fertilization (Hain et al., 2010; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014; Jaccard
et al., 2016) The two subsequent pulses, centred 14.8 and 12.9 ka, are
associated with enhanced air-sea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean (T.
Li et al., 2020), iron fertilization in the South Atlantic and North
Pacific (Lambert et al., 2021) and rapid increase in soil respiration
owing to the resumption of AMOC and associated southward migration of
the ITCZ (Bauska et al., 2016; Marcott et al., 2014). Rapid warming of
high northern latitudes contributed to thaw permafrost, possibly
liberating labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al., 2014;
Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019).
Ocean surface pH reconstructions indicate that the ocean was
oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the early, mid-LDT
(Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b; Shao et al., 2019; Shuttleworth et al.,
2021), suggesting that ocean sources at that time may have been larger
than terrestrial sources. Over the course of the LDT, the decrease in
northern hemisphere permafrost carbon stocks has been more than
compensated by an increase in the carbon stocks of mineral soils,
peatland and vegetation (Lindgren et al., 2018; Jeltsch-Thömmes et al.,
2019). The land biosphere was, on average, a net sink for atmospheric
carbon and accumulated several hundred Gt of carbon over the LDT.

Detailed investigations reveal that Antarctic air temperatures, and more
generally Southern Hemisphere (30°S–60°S) proxy temperature
reconstructions, led the rise in *p*CO~2~ at the onset of the LDT, 18 ka
ago, by several hundred years (Shakun et al., 2012; Chowdhry Beeman et
al., 2019). Atmospheric CO~2~ led reconstructed global average
temperature by several centuries (Shakun et al., 2012), corroborating
the importance of CO~2~ as an amplifier of orbitally driven warming.
During the LDT, the phasing between Antarctic air temperature and
atmospheric GHG concentration changes was nearly synchronous, yet
variable, owing to the complex nature of the mechanisms modulating the
global carbon cycle (Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Mean ocean
temperature reconstructions, based on noble gas extracted from Antarctic
ice are closely correlated with Antarctic air temperature and *p*CO~2~
records, emphasizing the role the Southern Ocean is playing in
modulating global climate variability (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos
et al., 2019).

Enhanced mid-ocean ridge magmatism and/or hydrothermal activity
modulated by sea level rise has recently been hypothesized to have
contributed to the deglacial CO~2~ rise (Crowley et al., 2015; Lund et
al., 2016; Huybers and Langmuir, 2017; Stott et al., 2019b). While
geological carbon release may have affected the ocean’s radiocarbon
budget (Ronge et al., 2016; Rafter et al., 2019; Stott et al., 2019b),
model results suggest that the potential contribution of geological
carbon sources to the atmosphere remained small (Roth and Joos, 2012;
Hasenclever et al., 2017).

Simulations of Earth models of intermediate complexity (EMIC) with
coupled glacial–interglacial climate and the carbon cycle were able to
reproduce first-order changes in the atmospheric CO~2~ content for the
first time in recent years (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017; Khatiwala et
al., 2019). The most important processes accounting for the full
deglacial CO~2~ amplitude in the models include solubility changes,
changes in oceanic circulation and marine carbonate chemistry. The
effect of the terrestrial carbon cycle, variable volcanic outgassing and
the temperature dependence on the oceanic remineralization length scale
contribute less than 15 ppm CO~2~ between the glacial and interglacial
intervals of the cycles. However, details in the simulated response of
the marine carbon cycle and atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations to changes
in ocean circulation depend to a large degree on model parametrization
(Gottschalk et al., 2019).

Independent paleoclimatic evidence suggests with *high confidence* that
marine and terrestrial CH~4~ and N~2~O emissions are highly sensitive to
climate on (sub)centennial time scales. Limited, yet internally
consistent ice core measurements indicate with *medium confidence* that
pulsed geologic CH~4~ release from continental margins associated with
warming remained negligible across the LDT. Multiple lines of evidence
suggest with *high confidence* that CO~2~ was released from the ocean
interior on centennial time scales during the LDT in response to, or
associated with warming, contributing to the transition out of the last
glacial stage to the current interglacial period.

Multiple lines of evidence inferred from marine sediment proxies
indicate with *low to medium confidence* that the millennial rates of
CO~2~ concentration change in the atmosphere during the last 56 Myr were
at least four to five times lower than during the last century (Figure
5.3). In spite of uncertainties in ice core reconstructions related to
delayed enclosure of air bubbles, which tend to smooth the records,
there is *high confidence* that the rates of atmospheric CO~2~ and CH~4~
change during the last century were at least 10 and five times faster,
respectively, than the maximum centennial growth rate averages of those
gases during the last 800 kyr (Fig. 5.4).

1.  []{#_Toc70535647 .anchor}Holocene Changes

Atmospheric GHG concentrations were much less variable during the
pre-industrial Holocene (from 11.7 ka to 1750 CE). Atmospheric CH~4~
concentrations decreased at the beginning of the Holocene, consistent
with a general weakening of boreal sources (Yang et al., 2017; Beck et
al., 2018) and further decline during the mid-Holocene owing to a
reduction in Southern Hemisphere emissions concomitant with a southward
shift of the ITCZ (Singarayer et al., 2011; Beck et al., 2018).
Atmospheric CH~4~ concentrations increased about 5 ka, which prompted
the hypothesis of an early anthropogenic influence related to land-use
changes in southeast Asia (Ruddiman et al., 2016). However, stable
isotope compositions on CH~4~ extracted from Greenland and Antarctic ice
(Beck et al., 2018) reveal that natural emissions located in the
southern tropics were responsible for the rise in atmospheric CH~4~
concentrations, in line with model simulations (Singarayer et al., 2011)
thus disputing the early anthropogenic influence on the global CH~4~
budget. Atmospheric N~2~O concentrations increased slightly (20 ppb)
across the Holocene, associated with a gradual decline in its nitrogen
stable isotope composition (H. Fischer et al., 2019). The combined
signal is consistent with a small increase in terrestrial emissions,
offset by a reduction in marine emissions (Schilt et al., 2010b; H.
Fischer et al., 2019).

The early Holocene decrease in CO~2~ concentration by about 5 ppm
(Schmitt et al., 2012) has been attributed to post-glacial regrowth in
terrestrial biomass and a gradual increase in peat reservoirs over the
Holocene, resulting in the sequestration of several hundred PgC (Yu et
al., 2010; Nichols and Peteet, 2019). Peat accumulation rates in boreal
and temperate regions were higher under warmer summer conditions in the
early to mid-Holocene (Loisel et al., 2014; Stocker et al., 2017). The
20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO~2~ starting 7 ka has been
attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate
change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate
deposition (Menviel and Joos, 2012; Brovkin et al., 2016), consistent
with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO~2~ extracted from
Antarctic ice (Elsig et al., 2009; Schmitt et al., 2012). These isotopic
measurements do not support an early anthropogenic influence on
atmospheric CO~2~ due to land-use change and forest clearing (Ruddiman
et al., 2016). Recent paleoceanographic evidence suggests that
remineralized carbon outgassing associated with increased Southern Ocean
circulation and upwelling (Studer et al., 2018), possibly promoted by
stronger Southern Hemisphere westerly winds (Saunders et al., 2018),
could have additionally contributed to the late Holocene increase in
atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations. However, the role of these mechanisms
remained insignificant in transient Holocene ESM simulations (Brovkin et
al., 2019). Overall, as in AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5), there is *medium
confidence* in the key drivers of the CO~2~ increase between the early
Holocene and the beginning of the industrial era, yet there is *low
confidence* in the relative contributions of these drivers due to
insufficient quantitative constraints on particular processes.

Historical Trends, Variability and Budgets of CO~2~, CH~4~, and N~2~O  {#historical-trends-variability-and-budgets-of-co2-ch4-and-n2o .AR6Chap5Level151}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section assesses the trends and variability in atmospheric
accumulation of the three main greenhouse gases (GHGs) – CO~2~, CH~4~
and N~2~O – their ocean and terrestrial sources and sinks as well as
their budgets during the Industrial Era (1750–2019). Emphasis is placed
on the more recent contemporary period (1959–2019) where understanding
is increasingly better constrained by atmospheric, ocean and land
observations. The section also assesses our increased understanding of
the anthropogenic forcing and processes driving the trends, as well as
how variability at the seasonal to decadal scales provide insights on
the mechanism governing long-term trends and emerging
biogeochemical-climate feedbacks with their regional characteristics.

    .anchor}Anthropogenic CO~2~ Emissions

There are two anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide (CO~2~): fossil
emissions and net emissions (including removals) resulting from land-use
change and land management (also shown in this chapter as LULUCF:
land-use, land-use change, and forestry; in previous IPCC reports it has
been termed forestry and other land use, FOLU). Fossil CO~2~ emissions
include the combustion of the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas, covering
all sectors of the economy (electricity, transport, industrial, and
buildings), fossil carbonates such as in cement manufacturing, and other
industrial processes such as the production of chemicals and fertilizers
(Figure 5.5a). Fossil CO~2~ emissions are estimated by combining
economic activity data and emission factors, with different levels of
methodological complexity (tiers) or approaches (e.g., IPCC Guidelines
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). Several organizations or
groups provide estimates of fossil CO~2~ emissions, with each dataset
having slightly different system boundaries, methods, activity data, and
emission factors (Andrew, 2020). Datasets cover different time periods,
which can dictate the datasets and methods that are used for a
particular application. The data reported here is from an annually
updated data source that combines multiple sources to maximise temporal
coverage (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The uncertainty in global fossil
CO~2~ emissions is estimated to be ±5% (1 standard deviation).

Fossil CO~2~ emissions have grown continuously since the beginning of
the industrial era (Figure 5.5) with short intermissions due to global
economic crises or social instability (Peters et al., 2012;
Friedlingstein et al., 2020). In the most recent decade (2010–2019),
fossil CO~2~ emissions reached an average 9.6 ± 0.5 PgC yr^–1^ and were
responsible for 86% of all anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions. In 2019,
fossil CO~2~ emissions were estimated to be 9.9 []{#_Hlk29326648
.anchor}± 0.5 PgC yr^–1^ excluding carbonation (Friedlingstein et al.,
2020), the highest on record. These estimates exclude the cement
carbonation sink of around 0.2 PgC yr^–1^. Fossil CO~2~ emissions grew
at 0.9% yr^–1^ in the 1990s, increasing to 3.0% per year in the 2000s,
and reduced to 1.2% from 2010 to 2019. The slower growth in fossil CO~2~
emissions in the last decade is due to a slowdown in growth from coal
use. CO~2~ emissions from coal use grew at 4.8% yr^–1^ in the 2000s, but
slowed to 0.4% yr^–1^ in the 2010s. CO~2~ emissions from oil use grew
steadily at 1.1% yr^–1^ in both the 2000s and 2010s. CO~2~ emissions
from gas use grew at 2.5% yr^–1^ in the 2000s and 2.4% yr^–1^ in 2010s,
but has showed signs of accelerated growth of 3% yr^–1^ since 2015 (G.P.
Peters et al., 2020). Direct CO~2~ emissions from carbonates in cement
production are around 4% of total fossil CO~2~ emissions, and grew at
5.8% yr^–1^ in the 2000s but a slower 2.4% yr^–1^ in the 2010s. The
uptake of CO~2~ in cement infrastructure (carbonation) offsets about one
half of the carbonate emissions from current cement production
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). These results are robust across the
different fossil CO~2~ emission datasets, despite minor differences in
levels and rates, as expected given the reported uncertainties (Andrew,
2020). During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid, temporary
decline in fossil CO~2~ emissions, estimated to be around 7% based on a
synthesis of four estimates. (Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 ; Forster et al.,
2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020; Z. Liu et al.,

    the period 1870 to 2019, with ‘others’ representing flaring,
    emissions from carbonates during cement manufacture. Data sources:
    (Boden et al., 2017; IEA, 2017; Andrew, 2018; BP, 2018; Le Quéré et
    al., 2018a; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). (b) The net land use

    models and 16 Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) for the
    global annual carbon budget 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The
    three bookkeeping models are from []{#_Hlk74838015 .anchor}Hansis et
    al., 2015; Houghton and Nassikas, 2017; Gasser et al., 2020 and are
    all updated to 2019; their average is used to determine the net land
    use change flux in the annual global carbon budget (black line). The
    DGVM estimates are the result of differencing a simulation with and
    without land use changes run under observed historical climate and
    CO~2~, following the Trendy v9 protocol; they are used to provide an
    uncertainty range to the bookkeeping estimates (Friedlingstein et
    al., 2020). All estimates are unsmoothed annual data. Estimates
    differ in process comprehensiveness of the models and in definition
    of flux components included in the net land use change flux. Further
    details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter
    data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.5 HERE\] **

The global net flux from land-use change and land management is composed
of carbon fluxes from land-use conversions, land management and changes
therein (Pongratz et al., 2018) and is equivalent to the LULUCF fluxes
from the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector (Jia et
al., 2019). It consists of gross emissions (loss of biomass and soil
carbon in clearing or logging, harvested product decay, emissions from
peat drainage and burning, degradation) and gross removals (CO~2~ uptake
in natural vegetation regrowing after harvesting or agricultural
abandonment, afforestation). The LULUCF flux relates to direct human
interference with terrestrial vegetation, as opposed to the natural
carbon fluxes occurring due to interannual variability or trends in
environmental conditions (in particular, climate, CO~2~, and nutrient
deposition) (Houghton, 2013).

(SRCCL; IPCC, 2019a) allows more accurate estimates of gross and net
fluxes due to the availability of more models, model advancement in
terms of inclusiveness of land-use practices (see below), and advanced
land-use forcings (Ciais et al., 2013; Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017;
Hurtt et al., 2020). In addition, important terminological discrepancies
were resolved. First, synergistic effects of land-use change and
environmental changes have been identified as a key reason for the large
discrepancies between model estimates of the LULUCF flux, explaining up
to 50% of differences (Pongratz et al., 2014; Stocker and Joos, 2015;
Gasser et al. 2020). Another reason for discrepancies relates to natural
fluxes being considered as part of the LULUCF flux when occurring on
managed land in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) national GHG inventories; these fluxes are considered
part of the natural terrestrial sink in global vegetation models and
excluded in bookkeeping models (Grassi et al., 2018). LULUCF fluxes
following national GHG inventories or Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) datasets, including recent estimates
(Tubiello et al., 2021), are thus excluded from our global assessment,
but their comparison against the academic approach is available
elsewhere – at the global scale (Jia et al., 2019) and European level
(Petrescu et al., 2020).

Land-use-related component fluxes can be verified by the growing
databases of global satellite-based biomass observations in combination
with information on remotely sensed land cover change. However, they
differ from bookkeeping and modelling with Dynamic Global Vegetation
Models (DGVMs) in excluding legacy emissions from pre-satellite-era
land-use change and land management, and neglecting soil carbon changes,
often focusing on gross deforestation, not regrowth (Jia et al., 2019).

For the decade 2010–2019, average emissions were estimated at 1.6 ± 0.7
PgC yr^–1^ (mean ± standard deviation, 1 sigma; Friedlingstein et al.,
2020). A *likely* general upward trend since 1850 is reversed during the
second part of the 20th century (Figure 5.5b). Trends since the 1980s
have *low confidence* because they differ between estimates, which is
related inter alia to Houghton and Nassikas (2017) using a different
land-use forcing than Hansis et al. (2015) and the DGVMs. Higher
emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs run under transient
environmental conditions compared to bookkeeping estimates, because the
DGVM estimate includes the loss of additional sink capacity. Because the
transient setup requires a reference simulation without land-use change
to separate anthropogenic fluxes from natural land fluxes, LULUCF
estimates by DGVMs include the sink forests that would have developed in
response to environmental changes on areas that in reality have been
cleared (Pongratz et al., 2014). The agricultural areas that replaced
these forests have a reduced residence time of carbon, lacking woody
material, and thus provide a substantially smaller additional sink over
time (Gitz and Ciais, 2003). The loss of additional sink capacity is
growing in particular with atmospheric CO~2~ and increases DGVM-based
LULUCF flux estimates relative to bookkeeping estimates over time
(Figure 5.5).

Gross emissions are on average two to three times larger than the net
flux from LULUCF, increasing from an average of 3.5 ± 1.2 PgC yr^−1^ for
the decade of the 1960s to an average of 4.4 ± 1.6 PgC yr^−1^ during
2010–2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Gross removals partly balance
these gross emissions to yield as the sum the net flux from LULUCF and
increase from –2.0 ± 0.7 PgC yr^−1^ for the 1960s to –2.9 ± 1.2 PgC
yr^−1^ during 2010–2019. These large gross fluxes show the relevance of
land management, such as harvesting or rotational agriculture, and the
large potential to reduce emissions by halting deforestation and
degradation.

More evidence on the pre-industrial LULUCF flux has emerged since AR5 in
the form of new estimates of cumulative carbon losses until today, and
of a better understanding of natural carbon cycle processes over the
Holocene (Ciais et al., 2013). Cumulative carbon losses by land-use
activities since the start of agriculture and forestry (pre-industrial
and industrial era) have been estimated at 116 PgC based on global
compilations of carbon stocks for soils (Sanderman et al., 2017) with
about 70 PgC of this occurring prior to 1750, and for vegetation as 447
PgC (inner quartiles of 42 calculations: 375–525 PgC) (Erb et al.,
2018). Emissions prior to 1750 can be estimated by subtracting the
post-1750 LULUCF flux from Table 5.1 from the combined soil and
vegetation losses until today; they would then amount to 328 (161–501)
PgC assuming error ranges are independent. A share of 353 (310–395) PgC
from prior to 1800 has indirectly been suggested as the difference
between net biosphere flux and terrestrial sink estimates, which is
compatible with ice-core records due to a low airborne fraction of
anthropogenic emissions in pre-industrial times (Erb et al., 2018; see
also Section 5.1.2.3). *Low confidence* is assigned to pre-industrial
emissions estimates.

Since AR5, evidence emerged that the LULUCF flux might have been
underestimated as DGVMs include anthropogenic land cover change, but
often ignore land management practices not associated with a change in
land cover; land management is more widely captured by bookkeeping
models through use of observation-based carbon densities (Ciais et al.,
2013; Pongratz et al., 2018). Sensitivity studies show that practices
such as wood and crop harvesting increase global net LULUCF emissions
(Arneth et al., 2017) and explain about half of the cumulative loss in
biomass (Erb et al., 2018).

Atmospheric CO~2~ concentration measurements in remote locations began
in 1957 at the South Pole Observatory (SPO) and in 1958 at Mauna Loa
Observatory (MLO), Hawaii, USA (Keeling, 1960) (Figure 5.6a). Since
then, measurements have been extended to multiple locations around the
world (Bacastow et al., 1980; Conway et al., 1994; Nakazawa et al.,
1997). In addition, high-density global observations of total column
CO~2~ measurements have been made since 2009 by dedicated GHG-observing
satellites (Yoshida et al., 2013; O’Dell et al., 2018). Annual mean
CO~2~ growth rates are observed to be 1.56 ± 0.18 ppm yr^–1^ (average
and range from 1 standard deviation of annual values) over the 61 years
of atmospheric measurements (1959–2019), with the rate of CO~2~
accumulation almost tripling from an average of 0.82 ± 0.29 ppm yr^–1^
during the decade of 1960–1969 to 2.39 ± 0.37 ppm yr^–1^ during the
decade of 2010–2019 (Chapter 2). The latter agrees well with that
derived for total column (XCO~2~) measurements by the Greenhouse Gases
Observing satellite (GOSAT; Figure 5.6b). The interannual oscillations
in monthly mean CO~2~ growth rates (Figure 5.6b) show a close
relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Figure
5.6b) due to the ENSO-driven changes in terrestrial and ocean CO~2~
sources and sinks on the Earth’s surface (Section 5.2.1.4).

Multiple lines of evidence unequivocally establish the dominant role of
human activities in the growth of atmospheric CO~2~. First, the
systematic increase in the difference between the MLO and SPO records
(Figure 5.6a) is caused primarily by the increase in emissions from
fossil fuel combustion in industrialized regions that are situated
predominantly in the northern hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019). Second,
measurements of the stable carbon isotope in the atmosphere
(δ^13^C–CO~2~) are more negative over time because CO~2~ from fossil
fuels extracted from geological storage is depleted in ^13^C (Figure
5.6c; Rubino et al., 2013; Keeling et al., 2017). Third, measurements of
the δ(O~2~/N~2~) ratio show a declining trend because for every molecule
of carbon burned, 1.17 to 1.98 molecules of oxygen (O~2~) is consumed
(Figure 5.6d; Ishidoya et al., 2012; Keeling and Manning, 2014). These
three lines of evidence confirm unambiguously that the atmospheric
increase of CO~2~ is due to an oxidative process (i.e., combustion).
Fourth, measurements of radiocarbon (^14^C–CO~2~) at sites around the
world (Levin et al., 2010; Graven et al., 2017; Turnbull et al., 2017)
show a continued long-term decrease in the ^14^C/^12^C ratio. Fossil
fuels are devoid of ^14^C and therefore fossil fuel-derived CO~2~
additions decrease the atmospheric ^14^C/^12^C ratio (Suess, 1955).

    network (as in Chapter 2), and GOSAT monthly mean XCO~2~ time series
    are taken from National Institute for Environmental Studies (Yoshida

**\[END FIGURE 5.6 HERE\] **

Over the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions
that has accumulated in the atmosphere (referred to as airborne
fraction) has remained near constant at approximately 44% (Figure 5.7)
(Ballantyne et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b;
Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This suggests that the land and ocean
CO~2~ sinks have continued to grow at a rate consistent with the growth
rate of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions, albeit with large interannual and
sub-decadal variability dominated by the land sinks (Figure 5.7).

Since AR5, an alternative observable diagnostic to the airborne fraction
has been proposed to understand the trends in land and ocean sinks in
response to its driving atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations (Raupach et
al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). It is the sink rate that is defined
as the combined ocean and land sink flux per unit of atmospheric excess
of CO~2~ above pre-industrial levels (Raupach et al., 2014). The sink
rate has declined over the past six decades, which indicates that the
combined ocean and land sinks are not growing as fast as the growth in
atmospheric CO~2~ (Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019).
Possible explanations for the sink rate decline are that the land and/or
ocean CO~2~ sinks are no longer responding linearly with CO~2~
concentrations or that anthropogenic emissions are slower than
exponential (Figure 5.7 and Sections 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.1.4; Gloor et al.,
2010; Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). In addition, both
diagnostics are influenced by major climate modes (e.g. ENSO) and
volcanic eruptions that contribute to high interannual variability
(Gloor et al., 2010; Frölicher et al., 2013; Raupach et al., 2014),
suggesting high sensitivity to future climate change. Uncertain land-use
change fluxes (Section 5.2.1.2) influence the robustness of the trends.
Based on the airborne fraction (AF), it is concluded with *medium
confidence* that both ocean and land CO~2~ sinks have grown consistent
with the rising of anthropogenic emissions. Further research is needed
to understand the drivers of changes in the CO~2~ sink rate.

    .anchor}Ocean Carbon Fluxes and Storage

Since AR5 and the Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a
Changing Climate (SROCC), major advances in globally coordinated ocean
CO~2~ observations (Surface Ocean CO~2~ Atlas, SOCAT; and Global Ocean
Data Analysis Project, GLODAP), the harmonization of ocean and
coastal-observation-based products, atmospheric and oceanic inversion
models and forced global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) have
increased the level of confidence in the assessment of trends and
variability of air-sea fluxes and storage of CO~2~ in the ocean during
the historical period (1960–2018; see also Supplementary Materials
5.SM.1; Ciais et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2016; Landschützer et al.,
2016, 2020; Bindoff et al., 2019; DeVries et al., 2019; Gregor et al.,
2019; Gruber et al., 2019a, b; Tohjima et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et
al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020; Olsen et al., 2020). A major advance
since SROCC is that, for the first time, all six published observational
product fluxes used in this assessment, are made more comparable using a
common ocean and sea ice cover area, integration of climatological
coastal fluxes scaled to increasing atmospheric CO~2~ and an ensemble
mean of ocean fluxes calculated from three re-analysis wind products
(Supplementary Materials 5.SM.2; Landschützer et al., 2014, 2020;
Rödenbeck et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014; Denvil-Sommer et al., 2019;
Gregor et al., 2019; Iida et al., 2020). From a process point of view,
the ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon is a two-step set of abiotic
processes that involves the exchange of CO~2~, first across the air-sea
boundary into the surface mixed layer, followed by its transport into
the ocean interior where it is stored for decades to millennia,
depending on the depth of storage []{#_Hlk74838413 .anchor}(Gruber et
al., 2019a). Two definitions of air-sea fluxes of CO~2~ are used in this
assessment for both observational products and models: S~ocean~ is the
global mean ocean CO~2~ sink and F~net~ denotes the net spatially
varying CO~2~ fluxes (Hauck et al., 2020). Adjustment of the mean global
F~net~ for the pre-industrial sea-to-air CO~2~ flux associated with
land-to-ocean carbon flux term makes F~net~ comparable to S~ocean~
(Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Hauck et al., 2020).

There are multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence that
support with *high confidence* the finding that, in the historical
period, air-sea fluxes and storage of anthropogenic CO~2~ are largely
influenced by atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations, physical ocean processes
and physicochemical carbonate chemistry, which determines the unique
properties of CO~2~ in seawater []{#_Hlk74838801 .anchor}(Chapter 9 and
Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Wanninkhof et al., 2014; DeVries et al., 2017;
Gruber et al., 2019, 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020; McKinley et al., 2017;
2020). Here we assess three different approaches (Figures 5.8a,b and
5.9) that together provide *high* *confidence* that, during the
historical period (1960–2018), the ocean carbon sink (S~ocean~) and its
associated ocean carbon storage have grown in response to global
anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions (Gruber et al., 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020;
McKinley et al., 2020).

##### Ocean carbon fluxes and storage: Global multi-decadal trends  {#ocean-carbon-fluxes-and-storage-global-multi-decadal-trends .AR6Chap5Level451111}

In the first assessment approach, the mean global multi-decadal
(1960–2019) trends in the ocean sink (S~ocean~) for CO~2~ show a high
degree of coherence across the nine GOBMs and six *p*CO~2~-based
observational product reconstructions (1987–2018) which, despite a
temporary slowdown (or ‘hiatus’) in the 1990s, is also quasi-linear over
that period (Figure 5.8a; Gregor et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). This
coherence between the GOBMs and observations-based reconstructions
(1987–2018; r^2^=0.85) provides *high confidence* that the ocean sink
(S~ocean~ in Section 5.2.1.5) evaluated from GOBMs (1960–2019) grew
quasi-linearly from 1.0 ± 0.3 PgC yr^–1^ to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr^–1^ between
the decades 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO~2~
emissions (Figure 5.8a; Table 5.1; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et
al., 2020). The cumulative ocean CO~2~ uptake (105 ± 20 PgC) is 23% of
total anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions (450 ± 50 PgC) for the same period
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the *high confidence* in
the magnitude of the annual to decadal trends for S~ocean,~ this
assessment is moderated to *medium* c*onfidence* by the *low confidence*
in the currently inadequately constrained uncertainties in the
pre-industrial land-to-ocean carbon flux, the uncertain magnitude of
winter outgassing from the Southern Ocean, and the uncertain effect of
the ocean surface cool-skin, the effect of data sparsity, differences
between wind products and the uncertain contribution from the changing
land–ocean continuum on global and regional fluxes (Jacobson et al.,
2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2018; Bushinsky et al.,
2019; Gloege et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2020).
However, both GOBMs and *p*CO~2~-based observational products
independently reveal a slowdown or 'hiatus' of the ocean sink in the
1990s, which provides a valuable constraint for model verification and
leads to greater confidence in the model outputs (Figure 5.8a;
Landschützer et al., 2016; Gregor et al., 2018; DeVries et al., 2019;
Hauck et al., 2020). A number of studies point to the role of the
Southern Ocean in the global '1990s hiatus' in air-sea CO~2~ fluxes, but
provide different process-based explanations linking ocean temperature,
mixing and meridional overturning circulation (MOC) responses to
variability in large-scale climate systems, wind stress and volcanic
activity, as well as the sensitivity of the air-sea CO~2~ flux to small
changes in the atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic CO~2~
(Landschützer et al., 2016; DeVries et al., 2017; Bronselaer et al.,
2018; Gregor et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019a; Keppler and
Landschützer, 2019; McKinley et al., 2020; Nevison et al., 2020). Data
sparsity in the Southern Ocean could also be a factor amplifying the
global decadal perturbation of the 1990s (Gloege et al., 2020).
Therefore, while there is *high confidence* in the 1990s hiatus of the
global ocean sink for anthropogenic CO~2,~ and that the Southern Ocean
makes an observable contribution to it, there is still *low confidence*
in the attribution for the processes behind the 1990s hiatus (Section
5.2.1.3.2). Observed increases in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of
ocean pCO~2~ and reductions in the mean global buffering capacity
provide *high confidence* that the growing CO~2~ sink is also beginning
to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry
(Jiang et al., 2019). However, there is *medium confidence* that these
changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future
ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical
multi-decadal observed growth rate of S~ocean~ (Sections 5.1.2; 5.3.2
and 5.4.2, and Figure 5.8a; SROCC Section 5.2.2.3.2; Bates et al., 2014;
Sutton et al., 2016; Fassbender et al., 2017; Landschützer et al., 2018;
Jiang et al., 2019). A recent model-based study suggests that
re-emergence of previously stored anthropogenic CO~2~ is changing the
buffering capacity of the mixed layer and reducing the ocean sink for
anthropogenic CO~2~ during the historical period (Rodgers et al., 2020).
This trend is not reflected in observations-based products (Figure 5.8),
so we attribute a *low confidence*.

The second assessment approach makes use of six independent methods to
constrain the mean decadal ocean sink over the period 1990–2019 (Figure
5.8b). This provides a multi-decadal advance on the 1990–1999 decadal
constraint from (Denman et al., 2007) that has been widely used as a
model constraint for GOBMs used for the global carbon budget (Hauck et
al., 2020). The *medium confidence* attributed by this assessment of the
global multi-decadal trend (Figure 5.8a) is further supported by the
broad agreement in magnitude and trend of the decadal mean ocean CO~2~
uptake with assessments that also include additional observations-based,
independent methods such as ocean CO~2~ inversion and atmospheric CO~2~
and O~2~/N~2~ measurements (Figure 5.8b; Supplementary Materials Tables
5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2).

Here we provide a third comparative assessment approach depicting the
spatial coherence of ocean air-sea fluxes and storage rates of CO~2~ as
well as a quantitative assessment of both fluxes for the same period
(1994–2007; Figure 5.9). Observation-based *p*CO~2~ flux products show
that emissions of natural CO~2~ occur mostly in the tropics and
high-latitude Southern Ocean, and that the uptake and storage of
anthropogenic CO~2~ occurs predominantly in the mid-latitudes (Chapter
9, Figure 5.9 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). Strong ocean CO~2~ sink
regions are those in the mid-latitudes associated with the cooling of
poleward flowing subtropical surface waters as well as equatorward
flowing sub-polar surface waters, both of which contribute to the
formation of Mode, Intermediate and Deep water masses that transport
anthropogenic CO~2~ into the ocean interior on time scales of decades to
centuries in both hemispheres (Section 9.2.2.3 and Figure 5.9; DeVries,
2014; Gruber et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2020)). The mean decadal scale
magnitude and uncertainties of S~ocean~ from net air sea fluxes (F~net~)
were calculated from an ensemble of six observational-based product
reconstructions (Figure 5.9a) and the storage rates in the ocean
interior derived from multiple ocean interior CO~2~ datasets (Gruber et
al., 2019b; Figure 5.9b). The cumulative CO~2~ stored in the ocean
interior from 1800 to 2007 has been estimated at 140 ±18 PgC (Gruber et
al., 2019b). As reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.1; IPCC, 2019b), the
net ocean CO~2~ storage between 1994–2007 was 29 ± 4 PgC, which
corresponds to a mean storage of 26 ± 5% of anthropogenic CO~2~
emissions for that period (Gruber et al., 2019b). The resulting net
annual storage rate of anthropogenic CO~2~, equivalent to S~ocean~ for
the period mid-1994 to mid-2007 is 2.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr^–1^, which is in
very close agreement with the top-down air-sea flux estimate of S~ocean~
of 2.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr^–1^ from GOBMs and 1.9 ± 0.3PgC yr^–1^ from
*p*CO~2~-based observational products with the steady river carbon flux
correction of 0.62 PgC yr^–1^ for the same time period (Gruber et al.,
2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). This close agreement between these
independent ocean CO~2~ sink estimates derived from air-sea fluxes and
storage rates in the ocean interior support the *medium confidence*
assessment that the ocean anthropogenic carbon storage rates continue to
be determined by the ocean sink (S~ocean~) in response to growing CO~2~
emissions (Figure 5.9; McKinley et al., 2020;).

    5.SM.1); and (b) the regional characteristics of the storage fluxes
    of CO~2~ in the ocean interior for the same period (Gruber et al.,
    2019b). The dots reflect ocean areas where the 1-sigma standard
    deviation of Fnet from the 6 observation product is larger than the
    magnitude of the mean. This reflects source-sink transition areas
    where the mean Fnet is small and more strongly influenced by spatial
    and temporal variability across the products. Further details on

##### Ocean carbon fluxes and storage: Regional–global variability {#ocean-carbon-fluxes-and-storage-regionalglobal-variability .AR6Chap5Level451111}

This assessment aims to show how global variability can be regionally
forced (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019; Hauck et al.,
2020). Since AR5 and SROCC, advances in global ocean CO~2~ flux
products, GOBMs and atmospheric inversion models have strengthened
confidence in the assessment of how ocean regions influence mean global
variability and trends of ocean CO~2~ air-sea fluxes (F~net~; see
Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1; Ciais et al., 2013; Landschützer
et al., 2014, 2015; Rödenbeck et al., 2014; McKinley et al., 2017;
Bindoff et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020;
Hauck et al., 2020). The coherence in the regional variability of the
anomalies in F~net~ from three independent lines of evidence support
with *high confidence* that the non-steady state global
interannual-decadal variability of F~net~ has clear regional influences
(Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019). The tropical oceans
contribute the most to the global mean interannual variability
(Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d). The high latitude oceans,
particularly the Southern Ocean, contribute the most to the global-scale
decadal variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM5.1b,c;
(Landschützer et al., 2016, 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber et al.,
2019a; Hauck et al., 2020). The influence of the Southern Ocean on the
global mean decadal variability and the 1990s hiatus is supported by the
highest regional–global correlation coefficients (Supplementary
Materials Figures 5.SM.1a,c). In contrast, the equatorial oceans’
influence on global mean F~net~ has a low correlation because,
notwithstanding the coherence in interannual variability, it does not
show the same global mean trend of strengthening sink in response to
growing global emissions (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d; Gregor
et al., 2019). All regions, except the equatorial ocean, contribute to
varying extents to the multi-decadal trend of growth in the global ocean
sink (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1). Data sparseness in the
high latitudes and the relatively short length of the observational
records leads to *low confidence* in the attribution of the processes
that link regional–global variability to climate (Landschützer et al.,
2019; Gloege et al., 2020).

Regional decadal-scale anomalies in the variability of ocean CO~2~
storage have also emerged, probably associated with changes in the MOC,
which may influence the global variability in F~net~ (Chapter 9; DeVries
et al., 2017). In the interior of the Indian and Pacific sectors of the
Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic, the increase in the CO~2~
inventory from 1994 to 2007 was about 20% smaller than expected from the
atmospheric CO~2~ increase during the same period and the anthropogenic
CO~2~ inventory in 1994 (Sabine, 2004; Gruber et al., 2019a). There is
*medium confidence* that the ocean CO~2~ inventory strengthened again in
the decade 2005–2015 (DeVries et al., 2017). In the North Atlantic, a
low rate of anthropogenic CO~2~ storage at 1.9 ± 0.4 PgC per decade
during the time period of 1989–2003 increased to 4.4 ± 0.9 PgC per
decade during 2003–2014. This is associated with changing ventilation
patterns driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (Woosley et al.,
2016). In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, the rate of
anthropogenic CO~2~ storage also increased from 8.8 ± 1.1 (1σ) PgC per
decade during 1995–2005 to 11.7 ± 1.1 PgC per decade during 2005–2015
(Carter et al., 2019). However, in the Subantarctic Mode Water of the
Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the storage rate of the
anthropogenic CO~2~ was rather lower after 2005 than before (Section
9.2.3.2; Tanhua et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019). These changes have
been predominantly ascribed to the impact of changes in the MOC on the
transport of anthropogenic CO~2~ into the ocean interior due to regional
climate variability, in addition to the increase in the atmospheric
CO~2~ concentration (Section 9.2.3.1; Wanninkhof et al., 2010; Pérez et
al., 2013; DeVries et al., 2017, 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; McKinley et
al., 2020). []{#_Hlk52741739 .anchor}However, the low frequency of
carbon observations in the interior of the vast ocean leads to *medium
confidence* in the assessment of temporal variability in the rate of
regional ocean CO~2~ storage and its controlling mechanisms.

In summary, multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence
provide *high confidence* in the finding that the ocean sink for
anthropogenic CO~2~ has increased quasi-linearly over the past 60 years
in response to growing global emissions of anthropogenic CO~2,~ with a
mean fraction of 23% of total emissions. The *high confidence*
assessment is moderated to *medium confidence* due to a number of ocean
CO~2~ flux terms yet to be adequately unconstrained. Observed changes in
the variability of ocean pCO~2~ and observed reductions in the mean
global buffering capacity provide *high confidence* that the growing
CO~2~ sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in
ocean carbonate chemistry. However, there is *medium confidence* that
these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive
future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the
historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of S~ocean~.

    and Trends

##### Trend in land–atmosphere CO~2~ exchange  {#trend-in-landatmosphere-co2-exchange .AR6Chap5Level451111}

The global net land CO~2~ sink is assessed to have grown over the past
six decades (Ciais et al., 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b; Sarmiento et
al., 2010; Friedlingstein et al., 2019) (*high confidence*). Estimated
as residual from the mass balance budget of fossil fuel CO~2~ emissions
minus atmospheric CO~2~ growth and the ocean CO~2~ sink, the global net
land CO~2~ sink (including both land CO~2~ sink and net land-use change
emission) increased from 0.3 ± 0.6 PgC yr^–1^ during the 1960s to 1.8 ±
0.8 PgC yr^–1^ during the 2010s []{#_Hlk74839873 .anchor}(Friedlingstein
et al., 2020). An increasing global net land CO~2~ sink since the 1980s
(Figure 5.10) was consistently suggested both by atmospheric inversions
(e.g., Peylin et al., 2013) and by DGVMs (e.g., Sitch et al., 2015;
Friedlingstein et al., 2019). The northern hemisphere contributes more
to the net increase in the land CO~2~ sink compared to the southern
hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019), and boreal and temperate forests
probably contribute the most (Tagesson et al., 2020). Attributing an
increased net land CO~2~ sink to finer regional scales remains
challenging, but inversions of satellite-based column CO~2~ products
that have emerged since AR5 are a promising tool to further constrain
regional land-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange (Ciais et al., 2013; Houweling
et al., 2015; Reuter et al., 2017; O’Dell et al., 2018; Palmer et al.,
2019).

Carbon uptake by vegetation photosynthesis exerts a first-order control
over the net land CO~2~ sink. Several lines of evidence show enhanced
vegetation photosynthesis over the past decades (*medium to high
confidence*) (Figure 5.10), including increasing satellite-derived
vegetation greenness (e.g., see Chapter 2; Mao et al., 2016; Zhu et al.,
2016; Jia et al., 2019) and satellite-derived photosynthesis indicators
(e.g., Badgley et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), change in atmospheric
concentration of carbonyl sulphide (Campbell et al., 2017), enhanced
seasonal CO~2~ amplitude (Graven et al., 2013; Forkel et al., 2016),
observation-driven inference of increasing photosynthesis CO~2~ uptake
based mostly on enhanced water use efficiency (Cheng et al., 2017), and
DGVM simulated increase of photosynthesis CO~2~ uptake (Anav et al.,
2015).

Substantial progress has been made since AR5 on attributing change of
the global net land CO~2~ sink. Increasing global net land CO~2~ sink
since the 1980s is mainly driven by the fertilization effect from rising
atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations (Schimel et al., 2015; Sitch et al.,
2015; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019; O’Sullivan et al., 2019; Tagesson
et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) (*medium confidence*). Increasing
nitrogen deposition (de Vries et al., 2009; Devaraju et al., 2016;
Huntzinger et al., 2017) or the synergy between increasing nitrogen
deposition and atmospheric CO~2~ concentration (O’Sullivan et al., 2019)
could have also contributed to the increasing global net land CO~2~
sink. The effects of climate change alone on the global net land CO~2~
sink is so divergent that even the signs of the effects are not the same
across DGVMs (e.g., Huntzinger et al., 2017).

Lower-fire emission of CO~2~ and enhanced vegetation carbon uptake due
to reduced global burned area have contributed to the increasing global
net land CO~2~ sink in the recent decade (Arora and Melton, 2018; Yin et
al., 2020) (*low to medium confidence*). Satellite observations reveal a
declining trend in global burned area by about 20% over past two decades
(Andela et al., 2017; Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Forkel et al., 2019;
Jones et al., 2020), a trend most pronounced in regions like northern
Africa (Forkel et al., 2019; Zubkova et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020;
Jones et al., 2020) and Mediterranean Europe (Turco et al., 2016).
However, burned area trends are highly heterogeneous regionally with
increasing trends reported in regions like western United States (Holden
et al., 2018a; Abatzoglou et al., 2019) and southeastern Australia
(Canadell et al., 2020). Some regions (e.g. Amazon basin and Australia)
experienced record-breaking fire events in 2019 and 2020 (e.g., Boer et
al., 2020), whose effects on burned area trends remain to be explored.
The burned area trends were primarily attributed to both human-induced
climate change and human activities (Jolly et al., 2015; Andela et al.,
2017; Holden et al., 2018b; Turco et al., 2018; Teckentrup et al., 2019;
Bowman et al., 2020), as well as changing frequency of lightning in the
boreal region (Veraverbeke et al., 2017). In addition to changes in the
burned area, fire dynamics could affect the trend in land-atmosphere
CO~2~ exchange indirectly through increasing concentration of air
pollutants (see Section 6.3.4 for impacts of ozone and aerosol on the
carbon cycle; Yue and Unger, 2018; Lasslop et al., 2019).

Significant uncertainties remain for the land CO~2~ sink partition
processes due to challenges in reconciling multiple-scale evidence from
experiments to the globe (Fatichi et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2020),
due to large spatial and inter-model differences in diagnosing dominant
driving factors affecting the net land CO~2~ sink (Huntzinger et al.,
2017; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019), and due to model deficiency in
process representations (He et al., 2016). Nitrogen dynamics, a major
gap in DGVMs identified in AR5, have now been incorporated in about half
of the DGVMs contributing to the carbon budget of the Global Carbon
Project (GCP) (see Le Quéré et al. (2018a) for model characteristics)
and a growing number of Earth system models (ESMs) (Arora et al., 2020).
However, as the representations of carbon–nitrogen interactions vary
greatly among models, large uncertainties remain on how nitrogen cycling
regulates the response of ecosystem carbon uptake to higher atmospheric
CO~2~ (Walker et al., 2015; Wieder et al., 2019; Davies-Barnard et al.,
2020; Meyerholt et al., 2020); see Section 5.4.1). Fire modules have
been incorporated into 10 of 16 DGVMs contributing to the global carbon
budget (Le Quéré et al., 2018a), and a growing number of models have
representations of human ignitions and fire suppression processes (Rabin
et al., 2017; Teckentrup et al., 2019). There are also growing DGVM
developments to include management practices (Pongratz et al., 2018) and
the effects of secondary forest regrowth (Pugh et al., 2019), though
models still under-represent intensively managed ecosystems, such as
croplands and managed forests (Guanter et al., 2014; Thurner et al.,
2017). Processes that have not yet played a significant role in the land
CO~2~ sink of the past decades but can grow in importance, include
permafrost (Section 5.4) and peatlands dynamics (Dargie et al., 2017;
Gibson et al., 2019), have also been incorporated in some DGVMs (Koven
et al., 2015b; Burke et al., 2017a; Guimberteau et al., 2018). Growing
numbers and varieties of Earth observations are being jointly used to
drive and benchmark models, helping to further identify missing key
processes or mechanisms that are poorly represented in the current
generation of DGVMs (e.g., Collier et al., 2018).

##### Interannual variability in land–atmosphere CO~2~ exchange  {#interannual-variability-in-landatmosphere-co2-exchange .AR6Chap5Level451111}

The AR5 stated that the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO~2~
growth rate is dominated by tropical land ecosystems. A set of new
satellite measurements applied to assess the variability of the tropical
land carbon balance since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) confirm this
statement, including satellite column CO~2~ measurements, estimating the
recent anomalous land-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange induced by El Niño at
continental scale (e.g. J. Liu et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019), and
L-band vegetation optical depth, estimating tropical above-ground
biomass carbon stock changes (Fan et al., 2019). In addition, based on
medium evidence and medium agreement between studies with DGVMs and
atmospheric inversions, semi-arid ecosystems over the tropical zones
have a larger contribution to interannual variability in global
land–atmosphere CO~2~ exchange than moist tropical forest ecosystems
(*low to medium confidence*) (Poulter et al., 2014; Ahlstrom et al.,
2015; Piao et al., 2020).

Understanding the mechanisms driving interannual variability in the
carbon cycle has the potential to provide insights into whether and to
what extent the carbon cycle can affect the climate (carbon–climate
feedback), with particular interests over the highly climate-sensitive
tropical carbon cycle (e.g., Cox et al., 2013; X. Wang et al., 2014;
Fang et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018; Malhi et
al., 2018; see Section 5.4). Consistent findings from studies with
atmospheric inversions, satellite observations and DGVMs (e.g., Malhi et
al., 2018; Rödenbeck et al., 2018) lead to *high confidence* that the
tropical net land CO~2~ sink is reduced under warmer and drier
conditions, particularly during El Niño events. Interannual variations
in tropical land-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange are significantly correlated
with anomalies of tropical temperature, water availability and
terrestrial water storage (X. Wang et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2017;
Humphrey et al., 2018; Piao et al., 2020), whose relative contribution
are difficult to separate due to covariations between these climatic
factors. At continental scale, the dominant climatic driver of
interannual variations of tropical land-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange was
temperature variations (Figure 5.11; Piao et al., 2020), which could
partly result from the spatial compensation of the water availability
effects on land-atmospheric CO~2~ exchange (Jung et al., 2017).

**\[START FIGURE 5.11 HERE\]**

1.  **Interannual variation in detrended anomalies of the net land CO~2~
    sink and land surface air temperature during 1980–2019.**
    Correlation coefficients between the net land CO~2~ sink anomalies
    and temperature anomalies are show on the right bar plots. The net
    land CO~2~ sink is estimated by four atmospheric inversions (blue)
    and fifteen Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) (green),
    respectively (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Solid blue and green
    lines show model mean detrended anomalies of the net land CO~2~
    sink. The ensemble mean of DGVMs is bounded by the 1–σ inter-model
    spread in each large latitude band (North 30°N–90°N, Tropics
    30°S–30°N, South 90°S–30°S) and the globe. The ensemble mean of
    atmospheric inversions is bounded by model spread. For each
    latitudinal band, the anomalies of the net land CO~2~ sink and
    temperature (orange) were obtained by removing the long-term trend
    and seasonal cycle. A 12-month running mean was applied to reduce
    high-frequency noise. The bars in the right panels show correlation
    coefficients between the net land CO~2~ sink anomalies and
    temperature anomalies for each region. Two asterisks indicate
    P&lt;0.01, and one indicates P&lt;0.05. Grey shaded area shows the
    intensity of El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) as defined by the

    Pinatubo eruption) are indicated with light blue dashed lines.
    Temperature data are from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU),
    University of East Anglia (Harris et al., 2014). Anomalies were
    calculated following Patra et al. (2005), but using 12-month
    low-pass filter and detrended to obtain interannual variations.

This box presents an assessment of interactions between the carbon and
water cycles that influence the dynamics of the biosphere and its
interaction with the climate system. It also highlights carbon-water
trade-offs arising from the use of land-based climate mitigation
options. Individual aspects of the interactions between the carbon and
water cycles are addressed in separate chapters (Sections 5.2.1, 5.4.1,
8.2.3, 8.3.1, 8.4.1 and 11.6). The influence of wetlands and dams on
methane emissions is assessed elsewhere (Sections 5.2.2, 5.4.7 and
8.3.1), as well as the consequences of permafrost thawing (Section 9.5.2
and Box 5.1) and/or increased flooding (Sections 8.4.1, 11.5 and 12.4)
on wetland extent in the northern high latitudes and wet tropics.

**Does elevated CO~2~ alleviate the impacts of drought?**

Increasing atmospheric CO~2~ concentration enhances leaf photosynthesis
and drives a partial closure of leaf stomata, leading to higher
water-use efficiency (WUE) at the leaf canopy to ecosystem scales (Norby
and Zak, 2011; De Kauwe et al., 2013; Fatichi et al., 2016; Knauer et
al., 2017; Mastrotheodoros et al., 2017). Since AR5 (Box 6.3), a growing
body of evidence from tree-ring and carbon isotopes further confirms an
increase of plant water-use efficiency over decadal to centennial time
scales, with some evidence for a stronger enhancement of photosynthesis
compared to stomatal reductions (Frank et al., 2015; Guerrieri et al.,
2019; Adams et al., 2020).

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that WUE has increased in near
proportionality to atmospheric CO~2~ (*high confidence*) at a rate
generally consistent with Earth system models (ESMs), despite variation
in the WUE response to CO~2~ (De Kauwe et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2015;
Keeling et al., 2017; Lavergne et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2020). Both
field-scale CO~2~ enrichment experiments and process models show the
effect of physiologically induced water savings, particularly under
water-limiting conditions (De Kauwe et al., 2013; Farrior et al., 2015;
Lu et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2016). Plants can also benefit from reduced
drought stress due to enhanced CO~2~ without ecosystems-scale water
savings (Jiang et al., 2021). To some extent, this increased WUE offsets
the effects of enhanced vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on plant
transpiration (Bobich et al., 2010; Creese et al., 2014; Jiao et al.,
2019), but will have limited effect on ameliorating plant water stress
during extreme drought events (Xu et al., 2016; Menezes-Silva et al.,
2019; L. Liu et al., 2020), when leaf stomata are governed primarily by
soil moisture (Roy et al., 2016).

Leaf stomata closure can have large effects on land freshwater
availability because of reduced plant transpiration, leading in some
regions to higher soil moisture and runoff (Roderick et al., 2015; Milly
and Dunne, 2016; Y. Yang et al., 2019). However, increased water
availability is often not realized because other CO~2~ physiological
effects that enhance ecosystem evapotranspiration might offset the
gains. These effects include plant growth and leaf area expansion
(Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Ukkola et al., 2016; McDermid et al., 2021),
lengthening of the vegetative growing season (Frank et al., 2015; Lian
et al., 2021), and the effects of stomatal closure on near-surface
atmosphere that leads to increased air temperature and VPDs (Berg et
al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Grossiord et al.,
2020).

ESMs show no consensus about the net hydrological response to
physiological CO~2~ effects. Some studies show water savings as a
consequence of the CO~2~ effects on leaf stomata closure (Swann et al.,
2016; Lemordant et al., 2018), while other studies show that increased
leaf area offsets the gains from increased WUE (Mankin et al., 2019).
However, these projections are subject to ESM uncertainties to quantify
transpiration (Lian et al., 2021), among them the correct
representations of plant hydraulic architecture such as changes in xylem
anatomical properties and deep rooting (Nie et al., 2013; L. Liu et al.,
2020).

In conclusion, it is *very likely* that elevated CO~2~ leads to
increased WUE at the leaf level, concurrent with enhanced
photosynthesis. Increased CO~2~ concentrations alleviate the effects of
water deficits on plant productivity (*medium confidence*) but there is
*low confidence* for its role under extreme drought conditions. There is
*low confidence* that increased WUE by vegetation will substantially
reduce global plant transpiration and diminish the frequency and
severity of soil moisture and streamflow deficits associated with the
radiative effect of higher CO~2~ concentrations.

**How does drought affect the terrestrial CO~2~ sink?**

Water availability controls the spatial distribution of photosynthesis –
gross primary productivity (GPP) – over a larger part of the globe (Beer
et al., 2010) and, at local scale, drought decreases GPP more than
respiration (Schwalm et al., 2012) over most ecosystem types. This makes
water availability a major climatic driver of variability in net
ecosystem exchange (Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018). In
addition to suppressing photosynthesis, field evidence suggests that
droughts reduce the land CO~2~ sink, also through increasing forest
mortality and promoting wildfire (Allen et al., 2015; Brando et al.,
2019; Abram et al., 2021).

At the global scale, interannual variability in the atmospheric CO~2~
growth rate and global-scale terrestrial water storage from satellite
show that a lower global net land CO~2~ sink is associated with
below-average terrestrial water storage (Humphrey et al., 2018).
Atmospheric inversions based on surface and satellite column CO~2~
measurements show significant carbon release during drought events in
pan-tropic areas (Phillips et al., 2009; Gatti et al., 2014; J. Liu et
al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019). Regional extreme droughts in the
mid-latitudes also lead to decreased GPP and land CO~2~ sink (Ciais et
al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2016; W. Peters et al., 2020; Flach et al.,
2021). Droughts cannot be compensated by equivalent wet anomalies
because of the non-linear response of the terrestrial carbon uptake to
soil moisture (Green et al., 2019).

Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of sensitivity of the land carbon
fluxes to droughts. Global studies indicate stronger control of soil
moisture to variations in satellite proxies of GPP than VPD (Stocker et
al., 2019; L. Liu et al., 2020). However, given that VPD increases
exponentially with atmospheric warming, some studies suggest that VPD in
stomatal regulation will become increasingly more important under a
warmer climate (Novick et al., 2016; Grossiord et al., 2020). It is
difficult to isolate the relative contributions of warmer temperature,
higher VPD and lower soil moisture. This is because land-atmosphere
feedbacks cause a simultaneous increase of plant evaporative demand and
of root zone water deficit impairing plant root uptake (Berg et al.,
2016). These physiological responses can be further compounded by
drought legacies (Anderegg et al., 2015), changes in structure and
population dynamics due to forest mortality (McDowell et al., 2020),
disturbances associated with drought (fire, insects damage; Anderegg et
al., 2020) and possible trade-offs between resistance and resilience (X.
Li et al., 2020). Nonetheless, ESMs suggest that increased drought
effects under very high levels of global warming (about 4°C at the end
of the 21st century) contribute to the reduced efficiency of the land
sink (Green et al., 2019).

In conclusion, there is *high confidence* that the global net land CO~2~
sink is reduced on interannual scale when regional-scale reductions in
water availability associated with droughts occur, particularly in
tropical regions. There is also *high confidence* that the global land
sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and
associated drought conditions in some regions for high-emission
scenarios, specially under global warming above 4°C. However, there is
*low confidence* on how these water cycle feedbacks will play out in
lower emission scenarios (at 2°C global warming or lower) due to
uncertainties in regional rainfall changes and the balance between the
CO~2~ fertilization effect, through WUE, and the radiative impacts of
greenhouse gases.

**What are the limits of carbon dioxide removal from a water cycle
perspective?**

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options based on terrestrial carbon sinks
will require the appropriation of significant amounts of water at the
landscape level. Most mitigation pathways that seek to limit global
warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C require the removal of about 30 to 300
GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and afforestation/reforestation are
the dominant CDR options used in climate stabilization scenarios,
implying large requirements for land and water (Section 5.6; Beringer et
al., 2011; Boysen et al., 2017b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017; Jans et
al., 2018; Séférian et al., 2018b; Yamagata et al., 2018; Stenzel et
al., 2019). A review of freshwater requirements for irrigating biomass
plantations shows a range between 15 and 1250 km^3^ per GtC^−1^ of
biomass harvest. This is equivalent to a water requirement of 99–8250
km^3^ for the median BECCS deployment of around 3.3 GtC yr^−1^ (Smith et
al., 2016) in &lt;2°C-scenarios (Stenzel et al., 2021), assuming that
biomass is converted to electricity, which is substantially less
efficient than to heat. These large ranges are the result of different
assumptions about the type of biomass and yield improvements,
management, and land availability. The use of alternative feedstocks,
such as wastes, residues and algae, would lead to smaller water
requirements (Smith et al., 2019).

Most of the water consumed in BECCS is used to grow the feedstock, with
carbon capture and storage constituting a smaller portion across all
crops (Rosa et al., 2020), with an estimated evaporative loss of 260
km^3^ yr^−1^ for 3.3 GtC yr^−1^ (Smith et al., 2016). The same authors
also estimate water use for CDR through afforestation at 1040 km^3^
yr^−1^ for 3.3 GtC yr^−1^, including interception and transpiration,
adjusted for the original land cover’s water use. 

The impacts of different CDR options on the water cycle depend crucially
on regional climate, prior land cover, and scale of deployment (Trabucco
et al., 2008). Extensive irrigation for afforestation in drier areas
will have larger downstream impacts than in wetter regions, with the
difference in water use between the afforested landscapes and its
previous vegetation determining the level of potential impacts on
evapotranspiration and runoff (Jackson et al., 2005; Teuling et al.,
2017). Afforestation and reforestation sometimes enhances precipitation
through atmospheric feedbacks such as increased convection, at least in
the tropics (Ellison et al., 2017) and the increase in precipitation
can, in some regions, cancel out the increased evapotranspiration (Li et
al., 2018). 

In conclusion, extensive deployment of BECCS and
afforestation/reforestation will require larger amounts of freshwater
resources than used by the previous vegetation, altering the water cycle
at regional scales (*high confidence*). Consequences of high water
consumption on downstream uses, biodiversity, and regional climate
depend on prior land cover, background climate conditions, and scale of
deployment (*high confidence*). Therefore, a regional approach is
required to determine the efficacy and sustainability of CDR projects.

    .anchor}CO~2~ Budget

The global CO~2~ budget (Figure 5.12) encompasses all natural and
anthropogenic CO~2~ sources and sinks. Table 5.1 shows the perturbation
of the global carbon mass balance between reservoirs since the beginning
of the industrial era, circa 1750.

Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), a number of improvements have led to the
more constrained carbon budget presented here. Some new additions
include: (i) the use of independent estimates for the residual carbon
sink on natural terrestrial ecosystems (Le Quéré et al., 2018a); (ii)
improvements in the estimates of emissions from cement production
(Andrew, 2019) and the sink associated with cement carbonation (Cao et
al., 2020); (iii) improved and new emission estimates from forestry and
other land use (Hansis et al., 2015; Gasser et al., 2020); (iv) the use
of ocean observation-based sink estimates and a revised river flux
partition between hemisphere (Friedlingstein et al., 2020); and (v) the
expansion of constraints from atmospheric inversions, based on surface
networks and the use of satellite retrievals. 

The budget, based on the annual assessment by the GCP (Friedlingstein et
al., 2020), uses independent estimates of all major flux components:
fossil fuel and carbonate emissions (E~FOS~), CO~2~ fluxes from forestry
and other land use (E~LULUCF~), the growth rate of CO~2~ in the
atmosphere (G~atm~), and the ocean (S~ocean~) and natural land (S~land~)
CO~2~ sinks. An imbalance term (B~Imb~) is required to ensure mass
balance of the source and sinks that have been independently estimated:
E~FOS~ + E~LULUCF~ = G~atm~ + S~ocean~ + S~land.~ + B~Imb.~ All
estimates are reported with 1 standard deviation (±1σ, 1 sigma)
representing a likelihood of 68%.

Over the past decade (2010–2019), 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr^–1^ were emitted
from human activities, which were distributed between three Earth system
components: 46% accumulated in the atmosphere (5.1 ± 0.02 PgC yr^–1^),
23% was taken up by the ocean (2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr^–1^) and 31% was stored
by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems (3.4 ± 0.9 PgC yr^–1^) (Table
5.1). There is a budget imbalance of 0.1 PgCyr^–1^ which is within the
uncertainties of the other terms. Over the industrial era (1750–2019),
the total cumulative CO~2~ fossil fuel and industry emissions were 445 ±
20 PgC, and the LULUCF flux (= net land-use change in Figure 5.12) was
240 ± 70 PgC (*medium confidence*). The equivalent total emissions (685
± 75 PgC) was distributed between the atmosphere (285 ± 5 PgC), oceans
(170 ± 20 PgC) and land (230 ± 60 PgC; Table 5.1), with a budget
imbalance of 20 PgC.

This budget (Table 5.1) does not explicitly account for source/sink
dynamics due to carbon cycling in the land–ocean aquatic continuum
comprising freshwaters, estuaries, and coastal areas. Natural and
anthropogenic transfers of carbon from soils to freshwater systems are
significant (2.4–5.1 PgC yr^–1^) (Regnier et al., 2013a; Drake et al.,
2018). Some of the carbon is buried in freshwater bodies (0.15 PgC)
(Mendonça et al., 2017), and a significant proportion returns to the
atmosphere via outgassing from lakes, rivers and estuaries (Raymond et
al., 2013; Regnier et al., 2013a; Lauerwald et al., 2015). The net
export of carbon from the terrestrial domain to the open oceans is
estimated to be 0.80 PgC yr^–1^ (*medium confidence)*, based on the
average of (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018) and corrected
to account for 0.2 PgC buried in ocean floor sediments. These terms are
included in Figure 5.12. Inclusion of other smaller fluxes could further
constrain the carbon budget (Ito, 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

**\[START FIGURE 5.12 HERE\]**

1.  **Global carbon (CO~2~) budget (2010-2019)**. Yellow arrows
    represent annual carbon fluxes (in PgC yr^-1^) associated with the
    natural carbon cycle estimated for the time prior to the industrial
    era, around 1750. Pink arrows represent anthropogenic fluxes
    averaged over the period 2010–2019. The rate of carbon accumulation
    in the atmosphere is equal to net land-use change emissions,
    including land management (called LULUCF in the main text) plus
    fossil fuel emissions, minus land and ocean net sinks (plus a small
    budget imbalance, Table 5.1). Circles with yellow numbers represent
    pre-industrial carbon stocks in PgC. Circles with pink numbers
    represent anthropogenic changes to these stocks (cumulative
    anthropogenic fluxes) since 1750. Anthropogenic net fluxes are
    reproduced from Friedlingstein et al. (2020). The relative change of
    *gross photosynthesis* since pre-industrial times is based on 15
    DGVMs used in Friedlingstein et al. (2020). The corresponding
    emissions by *Total respiration and fire* are those required to
    match the *net land flux*, exclusive of net land-use change
    emissions which are accounted for separately. The cumulative change
    of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of
    carbon cumulatively lost by net land use change emissions, and net
    carbon accumulated since 1750 in response to environmental drivers
    (warming, rising CO~2~, nitrogen deposition). The adjusted gross
    natural ocean–atmosphere CO~2~ flux was derived by rescaling the
    value in figure 1 of Sarmiento and Gruber (2002) of 70 PgC/yr by the
    revised estimate of the bomb ^14^C inventory in the ocean. The
    original bomb ^14^C inventoy yielded an average global gas transfer
    velocity of 22 cm/hr; the revised estimate is 17cm/h leading to
    17/22\*70=54. Dissolved organic carbon reservoir and fluxes from

    is from Gruber et al. 2019 extrapolated to 2015. Fossil fuel
    reserves are from BGR (2020); fossil fuel resources are 11,490 PgC
    for coal, 6,780 PgC for oil, and 365 PgC for natural gas. Permafrost
    region stores are from Hugelius et al. (2014); Strauss et al.
    (2017); Mishra et al., (2021) (see also Box 5.1) and soil carbon
    stocks outside of permafrost region from Batjes (2016); Jackson et
    al. (2017). Biomass stocks (range of seven estimates) are from Erb
    et al. (2018). Sources for the fluxes of the continuum land-to-ocean

### Methane (CH~4~): Trends, Variability and Budget  {#methane-ch4-trends-variability-and-budget .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO~2~ (Chapter 7)
and participates in tropospheric air chemistry (Chapter 6). The CH~4~
variability in the atmosphere is mainly the result of the net balance
between the sources and sinks on the Earth’s surface and chemical losses
in the atmosphere. Atmospheric transport evens out the regional CH~4~
differences between different parts of the Earth’s atmosphere. The
steady-state lifetime is estimated to be 9.1 ± 0.9 years (Section 6.3.1
and Table 6.2). About 90% of the loss of atmospheric CH~4~ occurs in the
troposphere by reaction with hydroxyl radical (OH), 5% by bacterial soil
oxidation, and the rest 5% by chemical reactions with OH, excited state
oxygen (O^1^D), and atomic chlorine (Cl) in the stratosphere (Saunois et
al., 2020). Methane has large emissions from natural and anthropogenic
origins, but a clear demarcation of their nature is difficult because of
the use and conversions of the natural ecosystem for human activities.
The largest natural sources are from wetlands, freshwater and geological
process, while the largest anthropogenic emissions are from enteric
fermentation and manure treatment, landfills and waste treatment, rice
cultivation and fossil fuel exploitation (Table 5.2). In the past two
centuries, CH~4~ emissions have nearly doubled, predominantly human
driven since 1900, and persistently exceeded the losses (*virtually
certain*), thereby increasing the atmospheric abundance as evidenced
from the ice core and firn air measurements (Ferretti, 2005; Ghosh et
al., 2015).

This section discusses both bottom-up and top-down estimates of
emissions and sinks. Bottom-up estimates are based on empirical
upscaling of point measurements, emission inventories and dynamical
model simulations, while top-down estimates refer to those constrained
by atmospheric measurements and chemistry-transport models in inversion
systems. Since AR5, a larger suite of atmospheric inversions using both
in situ and remote sensing measurement have led to better understanding
of the regional CH~4~ sources (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2). New ice core
measurements of ^14^C-CH~4~ are used for estimating the geological
sources of CH~4~ (Table 5.2). Compared to the IPCC SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a;
Jia et al., 2019), we provide a whole atmospheric sources-sinks budget
consisting of all emissions and losses.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535661 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564249 .anchor}Atmosphere

Since the start of direct measurements of CH~4~ in the atmosphere in the
1970s (Figure 5.13), the highest growth rate was observed from 1977 to
1986 at 18 ± 4 ppb yr^–1^ (multi-year mean and 1 standard deviation)
(Rice et al., 2016). This rapid CH~4~ growth followed the green
revolution with increased crop production and a fast rate of
industrialization that caused rapid increases in CH~4~ emissions from
ruminant animals, rice cultivation, landfills, oil and gas industry and
coal mining (Ferretti, 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Crippa et al., 2020).
Due to increases in oil prices in the early 1980s, emissions from gas
flaring declined significantly (Stern and Kaufmann, 1996). This explains
the first reduction in CH~4~ growth rates from 1985 to 1990 (Steele et
al., 1992; Chandra et al., 2021). Further emissions reductions occurred
following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 that triggered a reduction in
CH~4~ growth rate through a decrease in wetland emissions driven by
lower surface temperatures due to the scattering aerosols (Bândă et al.,
2016; Chandra et al., 2021). In the late 1990s through to 2006 there was
a temporary pause in the CH~4~ growth rate, with higher confidence on
its causes than in AR5: emissions from the oil and gas sectors declined
by about 10 Tg yr^–1^ through the 1990s, and atmospheric CH~4~ loss
steadily increased (Dlugokencky et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2012;
Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Chandra et al.,
2021). Methane growth rate began to increase again at 7 ± 3 ppb yr^–1^
during 2007–2016, the causes of which are highly debated since AR5
(Rigby et al., 2008; Dlugokencky et al., 2011; Dalsøren et al., 2016;
Nisbet et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016;
Schwietzke et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2017; Worden et al., 2017; He et
al., 2020); studies disagree on the relative contribution of
thermogenic, pyrogenic and biogenic emission processes and variability
in tropospheric OH concentration. The renewed CH~4~ increase is
accompanied by a reversal of δ^13^C trend to more negative values post
2007; opposite to what occurred in the 200 years prior (Ferretti, 2005;
Ghosh et al., 2015; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016;
Nisbet et al., 2019), suggesting an increasing contribution from animal
farming, landfills and waste, and a slower increase in emissions from
fossil fuel exploitation since the early 2000s (Patra et al., 2016;
Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). A comprehensive assessment
of the CH~4~ growth rates over the past four decades is presented in
Cross-Chapter Box 5.2.

    .anchor}Anthropogenic Methane (CH~4~) Emissions

The positive gradient between CH~4~ at Cape Grim, Australia (41^o^S) and
Trinidad Head, USA (41^o^N), and the bigger difference between Trinidad
Head and global mean CH~4~ compared to that between global mean CH~4~
and Cape Grim, strongly suggest that the northern hemisphere is the
dominant origin of anthropogenic CH~4~ emissions (Figure 5.13). The loss
rate of CH~4~ in troposphere does not produce a large positive
north-south hemispheric gradient in CH~4~ due to parity in hemispheric
mean OH concentration (Patra et al., 2014), or in the case of greater OH
concentrations in the northern rather than the southern hemisphere as
simulated by the chemistry-climate models (Naik et al., 2013). Coal
mining contributed about 35% of the total CH~4~ emissions from all
fossil fuel-related sources. Top-down estimates of fossil fuel emissions
(106 Tg yr^–1^) are smaller than bottom-up estimates (115 Tg yr^–1^)
during 2008–2017 (Table 5.2). Inventory-based estimates suggest that
CH~4~ emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr^–1^ between the
periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, with a dominant contribution from China
(Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020).
Furthermore, top-down estimates suggest that emissions from China’s coal
mines have continued to grow at a slower rate after 2010 (Miller et al.,
2019; Chandra et al., 2021). Emissions from oil and gas extraction and
use decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, but increased in the 2000s and
2010s (Dlugokencky et al., 1994; Stern and Kaufmann, 1996; Howarth,
2019; Crippa et al., 2020). The attribution to multiple CH~4~ sources
using spatially aggregated atmospheric δ^13^C data remained
underdetermined to infer the global total emissions from the fossil fuel
industry, biomass burning and agriculture (Rice et al., 2016; Schaefer
et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Worden et al., 2017; Thompson et
al., 2018).

In the agriculture and waste sectors (Table 5.2), livestock production
has the largest emission source (109 Tg yr^–1^ in 2008–2017) dominated
by enteric fermentation by about 90%. Methane is formed during the
storage of manure, when anoxic conditions are developed (Hristov et al.,
2013). Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure have increased
gradually from about 87 Tg yr^–1^ in 1990–1999 to 109 Tg yr^–1^ in
2008–2017 mainly due to the increase in global total animal numbers.
Methane production in livestock rumens (cattle, goats, sheep, water
buffalo) are affected by the type, amount and quality of feeds, energy
consumption, animal size, health and growth rate, meat and milk
production rate, and temperature (Broucek, 2014; Williams et al., 2015;
IPCC SRCCL 5.4.3). Waste management and landfills produced 64 Tg yr^–1^
in 2008–2017, with global emissions increasing steadily since the 1970s
and, despite significant declines in the USA, western Europe and Japan
(Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020).

Emissions from rice cultivation decreased from about 45 Tg yr^–1^ in the
1980s to about 29 Tg yr^–1^ in the decade 2000–2009, but increased again
slightly to 31 Tg yr^–1^ during 2008–2017, based on inventories data.
However, ecosystem models showed a gradual increase with time due to
climate change (*limited evidence, low agreement*) (Crippa et al., 2020;
Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Ito, 2020).

Biomass burning and biofuel consumption (including natural and
anthropogenic processes) caused at least 30 Tg yr^–1^ emissions during
2008–2017 and constituted up to about 5% of global anthropogenic CH~4~
emissions. Methane emissions from open biomass burning decreased during
the past two decades mainly due to reduction of burning in savanna,
grassland and shrubland (van der Werf et al., 2017; Worden et al.,
2017). There is recent evidence from the tropics that fire occurrence is
non-linearly related to precipitation, implying that severe droughts
will increase CH~4~ emissions from fires, particularly from the degraded
peatlands (Field et al., 2016).

    .anchor}Land Biospheric Emissions and Sinks

Freshwater wetlands are the single largest global natural source of
CH~4~ in the atmosphere, accounting for about 26% of the total CH~4~
source (*robust evidence, medium agreement*). Progress has been made
since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) in better constraining freshwater lake
and river emissions and reducing double counting with wetland emissions.
Bottom-up and top-down estimates for 2008–2017 are 149 and 180 Tg
yr^–1^, respectively, with a top-down uncertainty range of 159–199 Tg
yr^–1^ (Table 5.2). The large uncertainties stem from challenges in
mapping wetland area and temporal dynamics to landscape estimates, and
in scaling methane production, transport and consumption processes, that
are measured with small chambers or flux towers (Pham-Duc et al., 2017).
Both the top-down and bottom-up estimates presented in Table 5.2
indicate little increase in wetland CH~4~ emissions during the last
three decades, with the new estimates being slightly smaller than in AR5
due to updated wetland maps and ecosystem model simulations (Melton et
al., 2013; Poulter et al., 2017). The wetland emissions show strong
interannual variability due to the changes in inundated land area, air
temperature and microbial activity (Bridgham et al., 2013). Present
terrestrial ecosystem model simulated CH~4~ emission variability does
not produce strong correlation with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) cycle (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), although observation
evidence is emerging for lower CH~4~ emissions during El Niños and
greater emissions during the La Niña (Pandey et al., 2017).

Trees in upland and wetland forests contribute to CH~4~ emissions by
abiotic production in the canopy, by the methanogenesis taking place in
the stem, and by conducting CH~4~ from soil into the atmosphere (Covey
and Megonigal, 2019). There is emerging evidence of the important role
of trees in transporting and conducting CH~4~ from soils into the
atmosphere, especially in tropics (Pangala et al., 2017), whereas direct
production of CH~4~ by vegetation only has a minor contribution
(*limited evidence, high agreement*) (Bruhn et al., 2012; Covey and
Megonigal, 2019). The contribution of trees in transporting CH~4~ may
further widen the gap between the bottom-up and top-down estimates in
the global budget, particularly needing a re-assessment of emissions in
the tropics and in forested wetlands of temperate and boreal regions
(Pangala et al., 2017; Jeffrey et al., 2019; Welch et al., 2019;
Sjögersten et al., 2020).

Microbial methane uptake by soil comprises up to 5% (30 Tg yr^–1^) of
the total CH~4~ sink in 2008–2017 (Table 5.2). There is evidence from
experimental and modelling studies of increasing soil microbial uptake
due to increasing temperature (Yu et al., 2017), although evidence also
exists for decreasing CH~4~ consumption, possibly linked to
precipitation changes (Ni and Groffman, 2018). The estimate of global
methane loss by microbial oxidation in upland soils has been lowered
marginally by 4 Tg yr^–1^, compared to 34 Tg yr^–1^ in AR5, for the
period 2000–2009. Termites, an infraorder of insects (Isoptera) found in
almost all land masses, emitted about 9 Tg yr^–1^ of CH~4~ in 2000–2009.
Increased emissions from insects and other anthropods are projected
(Brune, 2018).

    .anchor}Ocean and Inland Water Emissions and Sinks

In AR5, the ocean CH~4~ emissions were reported together with geological
emissions, summing up to 54 (33–75) Tg yr^–1^. Coastal oceans, fjords
and mud volcanos are major sources of CH~4~ in the marine environment,
but CH~4~ flux measurements are sparse. Saunois et al. (2020) estimate
that the oceanic budget, including biogenic, geological and hydrate
emissions from coastal and open ocean, is 6 (range 4–10) Tg yr^–1^ for
the 2000s, which is in good agreement with an air-sea flux
measurement-based estimate of 6–12 Tg yr^–1^ (Weber et al., 2019). When
estuaries are included, the total oceanic budget is 9–22 Tg yr^–1^, with
a mean value of 13 Tg yr^–1^. A recent synthesis suggests that CH~4~
emissions from shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly from mangroves,
can be as high as 5–6 Tg yr^–1^ (Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020). The
reservoir emissions, including coastal wetlands and tidal flats,
contribute up to 13 Tg yr^–1^ (Borges and Abril, 2011; Deemer et al.,
2016). Methane seepage from the Arctic shelf, possibly triggered by the
loss of geological storage due to warming and thawing of permafrost and
hydrate decomposition, has a wide estimated range of 0.0–17 Tg yr^–1^
(Shakhova et al., 2010, 2014, 2017; Berchet et al., 2016); advanced eddy
covariance measurements put the best estimate at about 3 Tg yr^–1^ from
the East Siberian Arctic shelf (Thornton et al., 2020). The current flux
is expected to be a mix of pre-industrial and climate change-driven
fluxes, CH~4~ seepage is anticipated to increase in a warmer world (Dean
et al., 2018).

All geological sources around the world, including the coastal oceans
and fjords, are estimated to emit CH~4~ in the range of 35–76 Tg yr^–1^
(Etiope et al., 2019). There is evidence that the ventilation of
geological CH~4~ is *likely* to be smaller than 15 Tg yr^–1^ (Petrenko
et al., 2017; Hmiel et al., 2020). A lower geological CH~4~ ventilation
will reduce the gap between bottom-up estimations and those used in
top-down models (Table 5.2), but widen the gap in the ratio of fossil
fuel-derived sources to the biogenic sources for matching the
∆^14^C-CH~4~ observations.

Inland water (lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, estuaries) emissions are
proportionally the largest source of uncertainty in the CH~4~ budget.
Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), the inland water CH~4~ source has been
revised from 8–73 Tg yr^–1^ (1980s) to 117–212 Tg yr^–1^ (2000s) with
the availability of more observational data and improved areal estimates
(Bastviken et al., 2011; Deemer et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016;
DelSontro et al., 2018; Saunois et al., 2020). However, it is difficult
to estimate bottom-up CH~4~ emissions, due to the large spatial and
temporal variation in lake and river CH~4~ fluxes (Wik et al., 2016;
Crawford et al., 2017; Natchimuthu et al., 2017), uncertainties in
global measurements (Allen and Pavelsky, 2018), a relatively small
number of observations, and varying measurement methods – for example,
those neglecting ebullition, varying upscaling methods, and lack of
appropriate processes (Sanches et al., 2019; Engram et al., 2020; L.
Zhang et al., 2020). Accordingly, there is no clear accounting of inland
waters in top-down budgets, which is the main reason for the large gap
in bottom-up and top-down estimates of ‘other sources’ in the CH~4~
budget (Table 5.2). Despite recent progress in separating wetlands from
inland waters, there is double-counting in the bottom-up estimates of
their emissions (Thornton et al., 2016a). Although there is evidence
that regional human activities and warming increase inland water CH~4~
emissions (Beaulieu et al., 2019), the increase in the decadal emissions
since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) rather reflect improvements in the
estimate (*medium confidence)*, due to updates in the datasets and new
upscaling approaches (Saunois et al., 2020).

    .anchor}Methane (CH~4~) Budget

A summary of top-down and bottom-up estimates of CH~4~ emissions and
sinks for the period 2008–2017 is presented in Figure 5.14 (details in
Table 5.2 and the associated text for the emissions). In addition to
483-682 Tg yr^–1^ loss of CH~4~ in the troposphere by reaction with OH,
1–35 Tg yr^–1^ of CH~4~ loss is estimated to occur in the lower
troposphere due to Cl but are not included in the top-down models as
shown in Table 5.2 (Hossaini et al., 2016; Gromov et al., 2018; X. Wang
et al., 2019). The decadal mean CH~4~ burden/imbalance increased at the
rate of 30, 12, 7 and 21 Tg yr^–1^ in the 1980s (1980–1989), 1990s
(1990–1999), 2000s (2000–2009) and the most recent decade (2008–2017),
respectively (*virtually certain*), as can be estimated from observed
atmospheric growth rate (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 1).

Recent analysis using ∆^14^C-CH~4~ in ice samples suggest that CH~4~
emissions from fossil fuel exploitation are responsible for 30% of total
CH~4~ emissions (Lassey et al., 2007; Hmiel et al., 2020), which is
largely inconsistent with sectorial budgets where fossil fuel emissions
add up to 20% only (Ciais et al., 2013). However, recent model
simulations produce fairly consistent δ^13^C-CH~4~ values and trends, as
observed in the atmospheric samples using 20% fossil fuel emission
fraction (Ghosh et al., 2015; Warwick et al., 2016; Fujita et al., 2020;
Strode et al., 2020). Further research is needed to clarify the relative
roles of CH~4~ emissions from fossil fuel exploitation and freshwater
components. A key challenge is to accommodate higher estimated emissions
from these two components without a major increase in the sinks for
explaining the carbon and hydrogen isotopes variabilities at the same
time.

The atmospheric methane (CH~4~) growth rate has varied widely over the
past three decades, and the causes have been extensively studied since
AR5. The mean growth rate decreased from 15 ± 5 ppb yr^–1^ in the 1980s
to 0.48 ± 3.2 ppb yr^–1^ during 2000–2006 (the so-called
quasi-equilibrium phase) and returned to an average rate of 7.6 ± 2.7
ppb yr^–1^ in the past decade (2010–2019) (based on data in Figure
5.14). Atmospheric CH~4~ grew faster (9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr^–1^) over the
last six years (2014–2019) – a period with prolonged El Niño conditions,
which contributed to high CH~4~ growth rates consistent with behaviour
during previous El Niño events (Figure 5.14b). Because of large
uncertainties in both the emissions and sinks of CH~4~, it has been
challenging to quantify accurately the methane budget and ascribe
reasons for the growth over 1980–2019. In the context of CH~4~ emissions
mitigation, it is critical to understand if the changes in growth rates
are caused by emissions from human activities or by natural processes
responding to changing climate. If CH~4~ continues to grow at rates
similar to those observed over the past decade, it will contribute to
decadal scale climate change and hinder the achievement of the long-term
temperature goals of the Paris Agreement (Section 7.3.2.2; Nisbet et
al., 2019).

Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 1 shows the decadal CH~4~ budget derived
from the Global Carbon Project (GCP)-CH~4~ synthesis for 1980s, 1990s
and 2000s (Kirschke et al., 2013), and for 2010–2017 (Saunois et al.,
2020). The imbalance of the sources and sinks estimated by atmospheric
inversions (red bars) can be used to explain the changes in CH~4~
concentration increase rates between the decades (Table 5.2).

Since AR5, many studies have discussed the role of different source
categories in explaining the increase in CH~4~ growth rate since 2007
and a coincident decrease of δ^13^C–CH~4~ and δD–CH~4~ isotopes (Figure
5.13; Rice et al., 2016). Both ^13^C and D are enriched in mass-weighted
average source signatures for CH~4~ emissions from thermogenic sources
(e.g. coal mining, oil and gas industry) and pyrogenic (biomass burning)
sources, and depleted in biogenic (e.g. wetlands, rice paddies, enteric
fermentation, landfill and waste) sources. Proposed hypotheses for CH~4~
growth (2007–2017) are inconclusive and vary from a concurrent decrease
in thermogenic and increase in wetland and other biogenic emissions
(Nisbet et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016), increase in emissions
from agriculture in the tropics (Schaefer et al., 2016), a concurrent
reduction in pyrogenic and increase in thermogenic emissions (Worden et
al., 2017), or emission increase from biogenic sources and a slower
increase in emissions from thermogenic sources compared to inventory
emissions (Patra et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2018; Jackson et al.,
2020; Chandra et al., 2021).

A few studies emphasize the role of chemical destruction by hydroxyl
(OH; the primary sink of methane), in driving changes in the growth of
atmospheric methane abundance, in particular after 2006 (Rigby et al.,
2017; Turner et al., 2017). Studies applying three-dimensional
atmospheric inversion (McNorton et al., 2018), simple multi-species
inversion (Thompson et al., 2018), as well as empirical methods using a
variety of observational constraints based on OH chemistry (Nicely et
al., 2018; Patra et al., 2021), do not find trends in OH large enough to
explain the methane changes post-2006. On the contrary, global
chemistry-climate models based on fundamental principles of atmospheric
chemistry and known emission trends of anthropogenic non-methane
short-lived climate forcers simulate an increase in OH over this period
(Zhao et al., 2019; Stevenson et al., 2020; see Section 6.2.3). These
contrasting lines of evidence suggest that OH changes may have had a
small moderating influence on methane growth since 2007 (*low
confidence*).

Cross-Chapter Box 5.2 Figure 2 shows that modelled wetland emissions
anomalies for all regions did not exhibit statistically significant
trends (*high agreement between models, medium evidence*). Thus, the
inter-decadal difference of total CH~4~ emissions derived from inversion
models and wetland emissions, arises mainly from anthropogenic
activities. The time series of regional emissions suggest that progress
towards atmospheric CH~4~ quasi-equilibrium was primarily driven by
reductions in anthropogenic (fossil fuel exploitation) emissions in
Europe, Russia and temperate North America over 1988–2000. In the global
totals, emissions equalled loss in the early 2000s. The growth since
2007 is driven by increasing agricultural emissions from East Asia
(1997–2017), West Asia (2005–2017), Brazil (1988–2017) and Northern
Africa (2005–2017), and fossil fuel exploitations in temperate North
America (2010–2017; Lan et al., 2019; Crippa et al., 2020;
Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al.,
2021).

The results for the period before 2000 are available from two

inversions), as indicated within each panel separately, is subtracted
from the annual-mean time series for the calculation of anomalies for
each region. Further details on data sources and processing are
available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END CROSS-CHAPTER BOX 5.2, FIGURE 2 HERE\] **

There is evidence from emissions inventories at country level and
regional scale inverse modelling that CH~4~ growth rate variability
between 1988 and 2017 is closely linked to anthropogenic activities
(*medium agreement*). Isotopic composition observations and inventory
data suggest that concurrent emission changes from fossil fuels and
agriculture have played roles in the resumed CH~4~ growth since 2007
(*high confidence*). Shorter-term decadal variability is predominantly
driven by the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation on emissions
from wetlands and biomass burning (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), and
loss due to OH variations (*medium confidence*), but lacking
quantitative contribution from each of the sectors. By synthesizing all
available information regionally from a-priori (bottom-up) emissions,
satellite and surface observations, including isotopic information, and
inverse modelling (top-down), the capacity to track and explain changes
in, and drivers of, natural and anthropogenic CH~4~ regional and global
emissions has been improved since AR5, but fundamental uncertainties
related to OH variations remain unchanged.

### N~2~O: Trends, Variability and Budget {#n2o-trends-variability-and-budget .AR6Chap5Level2511}

In natural ecosystems, nitrous oxide (N~2~O) is primarily produced as a
by-product during the remineralization of organic matter via the primary
processes of nitrification and denitrification (Butterbach-Bahl et al.,
2013; Voss et al., 2013). The net N~2~O production is highly sensitive
to local environmental conditions such as temperature, oxygen
concentrations, pH and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrate, among
others, causing strong variability of N~2~O emissions in time and space,
even at small scales. Changes in the atmospheric abundance of N~2~O
result largely from the balance of the net N~2~O sources on land and
ocean, and the photochemical destruction of N~2~O in the stratosphere.

Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved understanding of N~2~O sources
allows for a more comprehensive assessement of the global N~2~O budget
(Table 5.3). This progress is based on extended atmospheric observations
(Francey et al., 2003; Elkins et al., 2018; Prinn et al., 2018),
improved atmospheric N~2~O inversions (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et
al., 2019), updated and expanded inventories of N~2~O sources
(Winiwarter et al., 2018; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019), as well as
improved bottom-up estimate of freshwater, ocean and terrestrial sources
(Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017; Buitenhuis et al.,
2018; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019).

The human perturbation of the natural nitrogen cycle through the use of
synthetic fertilizers and manure, as well as nitrogen deposition
resulting from land-based agriculture and fossil fuel burning has been
the largest driver of the increase in atmospheric N~2~O of 31.0 ± 0.5
ppb (10%) between 1980 and 2019 (*robust evidence*, *high agreement*)
(Tian et al., 2020). The long atmospheric lifetime of N~2~O implies that
it will take more than a century before atmospheric abundances stabilize
after the stabilization of global emissions. The rise of atmospheric
N~2~O is of concern, because of its contribution to the anthropogenic
radiative forcing (Chapter 7), and also because of the importance of
N~2~O in stratospheric ozone loss (Ravishankara et al., 2009; Fleming et
al., 2011; W. Wang et al., 2014).

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535668 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564256 .anchor}Atmosphere

The tropospheric abundance of N~2~O was 332.1 ± 0.4 ppb in 2019 (Figure
5.15), which is 23% higher than pre-industrial levels of 270.1 ± 6.0 ppb
(*robust evidence, high agreement*). Current estimates are based on
atmospheric measurements with high accuracy and density (Francey et al.,
2003; Elkins et al., 2018; Prinn et al., 2018), and pre-industrial
estimates are based on multiple ice-core records (Section 2.2.3.2.3).
The average annual tropospheric growth rate was 0.85 ± 0.03 ppb yr^–1^
during the period 1995 to 2019 (Figure 5.15a). The atmospheric growth
rate increased by about 20% between the decade 2000–2009 and the most
recent decade of 2010–2019 (0.95 ± 0.04 ppb yr^–1^) (*robust evidence,
high agreement*). The growth rate in 2010–2019 was also higher than
during 1970–2000 (0.6–0.8 ppb yr^–1^; Ishijima et al., 2007) and the
30-year period prior to 2011 (0.73 ± 0.03 ppb yr^–1^), as reported by
AR5. New evidence since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3) confirms that, in the
tropics and subtropics, large interannual variations in the atmospheric
growth rate are negatively correlated with the multivariate ENSO index
(MEI) and associated anomalies in land and ocean fluxes (Ji et al.,
2019; Thompson et al., 2019; S. Yang et al., 2020) (Figure 5.15a).

As assessed by SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a), combined firn, ice, air and
atmospheric measurements show that the ^15^N/^14^N isotope ratio
(*robust evidence*, *high agreement*) and the predominant position of
the ^15^N atom in atmospheric N~2~O (*limited evidence*, *low
agreement*) in N~2~O has changed since 1940 (Figure 5.15b, c) whereas
they were relatively constant in the pre-industrial period (Ishijima et
al., 2007; Park et al., 2012; Prokopiou et al., 2017, 2018). SRCCL
concluded that this change indicates a shift in the nitrogen-substrate
available for denitrification, and the relative contribution of
nitrification to the global N~2~O source (*robust evidence*, *high
agreement*), which are associated with increased fertilizer use in
agriculture (Park et al., 2012; Snider et al., 2015; Prokopiou et al.,
2018).

Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), the mean atmospheric lifetime of N~2~O
has been revised to 116 ± 9 years (Prather et al., 2015). The small
negative feedback of the N~2~O lifetime to increasing atmospheric N~2~O
results in a slightly lower residence time (109 ± 10 years) of N~2~O
perturbations compared with that assessed by AR5 (118–131 years)
(Prather et al., 2015). The dominant N~2~O loss occurs through
photolysis and oxidation by O(1D) radicals in the stratosphere and
amounts to approximately 13.1 (12.4–13.6) TgN yr^–1^ (Minschwaner et
al., 1993; Prather et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2020).

    .anchor}Anthropogenic N~2~O Emissions

The AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3) and SRCCL (Section 2.3.3) concluded that
agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source of N~2~O emissions.
Since SRCCL (2.3.3), a new synthesis of inventory-based and modelling
studies shows that the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers and
manure on cropland and pasture, manure management and aquaculture
resulted in 3.8 (2.5–5.8) TgN yr^–1^ (average 2007–2016) (*robust
evidence, high agreement*) (Table 5.3; Winiwarter et al., 2018; FAO,
2019; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). Observations
from field-measurements (Song et al., 2018), inventories (Wang et al.,
2020) and atmospheric inversions (Thompson et al., 2019) further
corroborate the assessment of the SRCCL that there is a non-linear
relationship between N~2~O emissions and nitrogen input, implying an
increasing fraction of fertilizer lost as N~2~O with larger fertilizer
excess (*medium evidence*, *high agreement*). Several studies using
complementary methods indicate that agricultural N~2~O emissions have
increased by more than 45% since the 1980s (*high confidence*) (Figure
5.16 and Table 5.3; Davidson, 2009; Winiwarter et al., 2018;
Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020), mainly due to the
increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and manure. N~2~O emissions from
aquaculture are among the fastest rising contributors of N~2~O
emissions, but their overall magnitude is still small in the overall
N~2~O budget (Tian et al., 2020).

1.  **Decadal mean nitrous oxide (N~2~O) emissions for 2007–2016 and its
    change since 1850 based on process-model projections**. The total
    effect including that from anthropogenic nitrogen additions
    (atmospheric deposition, manure addition, fertilizer use and
    land-use) is evaluated against the background flux driven by changes
    in atmospheric CO~2~ concentration, and climate change. Fluxes are
    derived from the N~2~O Model Intercomparison Project ensemble of
    terrestrial biosphere models (Tian et al., 2019) and three ocean
    biogeochemical models (Landolfi et al., 2017; Battaglia and Joos,
    2018a; Buitenhuis et al., 2018). Further details on data sources and
    processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.16 HERE\] **

The principal non-agricultural anthropogenic sources of N~2~O are
industry, specifically chemical processing, wastewater, and the
combustion of fossil fuels (Table 5.3). Industrial emissions of N~2~O
mainly due to nitric and adipic acid production have decreased in North
America and Europe since the widespread installation of abatement
technologies in the 1990s (Pérez-Ramı́rez et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2011;
Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019). There is still considerable uncertainty
in industrial emissions from other regions of the world with contrasting
trends between inventories (Thompson et al., 2019). Globally, industrial
emissions and emissions from fossil fuel combustion by stationary
sources, such as power plants, as well as smaller emissions from mobile
sources (e.g., road transport and aviation) have remained nearly
constant between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (*moderate evidence*, *medium
agreement*) (Winiwarter et al., 2018; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019;
Tian et al., 2020). Wastewater N~2~O emissions, including those from
domestic and industrial sources, have increased from 0.2 (0.1–0.3) TgN
yr^–1^ to 0.35 (0.2–0.5) TgN yr^–1^ between the 1980s and 2007–2016
(Tian et al., 2020).

Biomass burning from crop residue burning, grassland, savannah and
forest fires, as well as biomass burnt in household stoves, releases
N~2~O during the combustion of organic matter. Updated inventories since
AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3) result in a lower range of the decadal mean
emissions of 0.6 (0.5–0.8) TgN yr^–1^ (van der Werf et al., 2017; Tian
et al., 2020). The attribution of grassland, savannah or forest fires to
natural or anthropogenic origins is uncertain, preventing a separation
of the biomass burning source into natural and anthropogenic.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535670 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564258 .anchor}Emissions from
    Ocean, Inland Water Bodies and Estuaries

Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), new estimates of the global ocean N~2~O
source derived from ocean biogeochemistry models are 3.4 (2.5–4.3) TgN
yr^–1^ for the period 2007–2016 (Figure 5.16; Manizza et al., 2012;
Suntharalingam et al., 2012; Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al.,
2017; Buitenhuis et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020). This is slightly
lower than climatological estimates from empirically based methods and
surface ocean data syntheses (Bianchi et al., 2012; S. Yang et al.,
2020). Nitrous oxide processes in coastal upwelling zones continue to be
poorly represented in global estimates of marine N~2~O emissions (Kock
et al., 2016), but may account for an additional 0.2–0.6 TgN yr^–1^ of
the global ocean source (Seitzinger et al., 2000; Nevison et al., 2004).

In the oxic ocean (&gt; 97% of ocean volume), nitrification is believed
to be the primary N~2~O source (Freing et al., 2012). In sub-oxic ocean
zones (Section 5.3), where denitrification prevails, higher N~2~O yields
and turnover rates make these regions potentially significant sources of
N~2~O (Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015; Ji et al.,
2015). The relative proportion of ocean N~2~O from oxygen-minimum zones
is highly uncertain (Zamora et al., 2012). Estimates derived from in
situ sampling, particularly in the eastern tropical Pacific, suggest
significant fluxes from these regions, and potentially account for up to
50% of the global ocean source (Codispoti, 2010; Arévalo-Martínez et
al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015). However, recent global-scale analyses
estimate lower contributions (4–7%, Battaglia and Joos, 2018b;
Buitenhuis et al., 2018). Further investigation is required to reconcile
these estimates and provide improved constraints on the N~2~O source
from low-oxygen zones.

Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic N on oceans can stimulate marine
productivity and influence ocean emissions of N~2~O. New ocean model
analyses since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), suggest a relatively modest global
potential impact of 0.01–0.32 TgN yr^–1^ (pre-industrial to present-day)
equivalent to 0.5–3.3% of the global ocean N~2~O source (Suntharalingam
et al., 2012; Jickells et al., 2017; Landolfi et al., 2017). However,
larger proportionate impacts are predicted in nitrogen-limited coastal
and inland waters downwind of continental pollution outflow, such as the
Northern Indian Ocean (Jickells et al., 2017; Suntharalingam et al.,
2019).

Inland waters and estuaries are generally sources of N~2~O as a result
of nitrification and denitrification of dissolved inorganic nitrogen,
however, they can serve as N~2~O sinks in specific conditions (Webb et
al., 2019). Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved emission factors, including
their spatio-temporal scaling, and consideration of transport within the
aquatic system allows for better constraint of these emissions (Murray
et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al.,
2019; Kortelainen et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Despite uncertainties
because of the side effects of canals and reservoirs on nutrient
cycling, these advances permit attribution of a fraction of inland water
N~2~O emissions to anthropogenic sources (Tian et al., 2020), which
contributes to the increased anthropogenic share of the global N~2~O
source in this report compared to AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013). As an
indirect consequence of agricultural nitrogen use and waste-water
treatment, the anthropogenic emissions from inland waters have increased
by about a quarter (0.1 TgN yr^–1^) between the 1980s and 2007–2016
(Tian et al., 2020).

1.  [[[]{#_Toc70535671 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564259 .anchor}]{#_Toc5716924
    .anchor}Emissions and Sinks in Non-agricultural Land

Soils are the largest natural source of N~2~O, arising primarily from
nitrogen processing associated with microbial nitrification and
denitrification (Table 5.3; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Snider et al.,
2015). Under some conditions, soils can also act as a net sink of N~2~O,
but this effect is small compared to the overall source (Schlesinger,
2013). Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved global process-based
models (Tian et al., 2019) suggest a present-day source of 6.7 (5.3–8.1)
TgN yr^–1^ (2007–2016 average), which is consistent with the estimate in
AR5. Process-based models and inventory-based methods show that
increased N deposition has enhanced terrestrial N~2~O emissions by 0.8
(0.4–1.4 TgN yr^–1^) relative to approximately pre-industrial times, and
by 0.2 (0.1–0.2) TgN yr^–1^ between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (*limited
evidence*, *medium agreement*) (Figure 5.16; Tian et al., 2019). This
estimate is at the high end of the range reported in AR5 (WGI, Section
6.4.3). Model projections further show that global warming has led to
increased soil N~2~O emissions of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr^–1^ since
approximately pre-industrial times, of which about half occurred since
the 1980s (*limited evidence*, *high agreement*) (Tian et al., 2019,
2020).

The SRCCL assessed that deforestation and other forms of land-use change
significantly alter terrestrial N~2~O emissions through emission pulses
following conversions, generally resulting in long-term reduced
emissions in unfertilized ecosystems (*medium evidence, high
agreement*). This conclusion is supported by a recent study
demonstrating that the deforestation-pulse effect is offset by the
effect of reduced area of mature tropical forests (Tian et al., 2020).

Uncertainties remain in process-based models with respect to their
ability to capture the complicated responses of terrestrial N~2~O
emissions to rain pulses, freeze–thaw cycles and the net consequences of
elevated levels of CO~2~ accurately (Tian et al., 2019). Emerging
literature suggests that permafrost thaw may contribute significantly to
arctic N~2~O emissions (Voigt et al., 2020), but these processes are not
yet adequately represented in models and upscaling to large-scale
remains a significant challenge.

    mean N~2~O concentration, multiplying a factor of 4.79 ± 0.05 Tg
    ppb^–1^ (Prather et al., 2012). Pool sizes for the other reservoirs
    are largely unknown. Further details on data sources and processing
    are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.17 HERE\] **

The synthesis of bottom-up estimates of N~2~O sources (Sections
5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4 and Figure 5.17) yields a global source of 17.0 (12.2 to
23.5) TgN yr^–1^ for the years 2007–2016 (Table 5.3). This estimate is
comparable to AR5, but the uncertainty range has been reduced primarily
due to improved estimates of ocean and anthropogenic N~2~O sources.
Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved capacity to estimate N~2~O
sources from atmospheric N~2~O measurements by inverting models of
atmospheric transport provides a new and independent constraint for the
global N~2~O budget (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Tian
et al., 2020). The decadal mean source derived from these inversions is
remarkably consistent with the bottom-up global N~2~O budget for the
same period, however, the split between land and ocean sources based on
atmospheric inversions is less constrained, yielding a smaller land
source of 11.3 (10.2 to 13.2) TgN yr^–1^ and a larger ocean source of
5.7 (3.4 to 7.2) TgN yr^–1^, respectively, compared to bottom-up
estimates.

Supported by multiple studies and extensive observational evidence
(Sections 5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4 and Figure 5.17), anthropogenic emissions
contributed about 40% (7.3; uncertainty range: 4.2 to 11.4 TgN yr^–1^)
to the total N~2~O source in 2007–2016 (*high confidence*). This
estimate is larger than in AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3) due to a larger estimated
effect of nitrogen deposition on soil N~2~O emission and the explicit
consideration of the role of anthropogenic nitrogen in determining
inland water and estuary emissions.

Based on bottom-up estimates, anthropogenic emissions from agricultural
nitrogen use, industry and other indirect effects have increased by 1.7
(1.0–2.7) TgN yr^–1^ between the decades 1980–1989 and 2007–2016, and
are the primary cause of the increase in the total N~2~O source (*high
confidence*). Atmospheric inversions indicate that changes in surface
emissions, rather than in the atmospheric transport or sink of N~2~O,
are the cause for the increased atmospheric growth rate of N~2~O
(*robust evidence, high agreement*) (Thompson et al., 2019). However,
the increase of 1.6 (1.4–1.7) TgN yr^–1^ in global emissions between
2000–2005 and 2010–2015 based on atmospheric inversions is somewhat
larger than bottom-up estimates over the same period, primarily because
of differences in the estimates of land-based emissions.

### The Relative Importance of CO~2~, CH~4~, and N~2~O {#the-relative-importance-of-co2-ch4-and-n2o .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The total influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the
Earth’s radiative balance is driven by the combined effect of those
gases, and the three most important – carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane
(CH~4~), nitrous oxide (N~2~O) – were discussed in the previous
sections. This section compares the balance of the sources and sinks of
these three gases and their regional net flux contributions to the
radiative forcing. CO~2~ has multiple residence times in the atmosphere
– from one year to many thousands of years (Box 6.1 in Ciais et al.,
2013) – and N~2~O has a mean lifetime of 116 years. They are both
long-lived GHGs, while CH~4~ has a lifetime of 9.0 years and is
considered a short-lived GHG (see Chapter 2 for lifetime of GHGs,
Chapter 6 for CH~4~ chemical lifetime, and Chapter 7 for effective
radiative forcing of all GHGs).

Figure 5.18 shows the contribution to radiative forcing of CO~2~, CH~4~,
N~2~O, and the halogenated species since the 1900s to more recent
decades. For the period 1960–2019, the relative contribution to the
total effective radiative forcing (ERF) was 63% for CO~2~, 11% for
CH~4~, 6% for N~2~O, and 17% for the halogenated species (Chapter 7;
Figure 5.18). The systematic decline in the relative contribution to ERF
for CH~4~ since 1850 is caused by a slower increase rate of CH~4~ in the
recent decades, at 6, 10 and 5 ppb yr^–1^ during 1850–2019, 1960–2019
and 2000–2019, respectively, in comparison with the increasing rate of
CO~2~ (at 0.7, 1.6 and 2.2 ppm yr^–1^, respectively) and N~2~O (at 0.4,
0.7 and 0.9 ppb yr^–1^, respectively; Figure 5.4). Owing to the shorter
lifetime of CH~4~, the effect of slower emission gain on the ERF
increase is evident at inter-decadal time scales.

**\[START FIGURE 5.18 HERE\]**

1.  **Contributions of carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane (CH~4~), nitrous
    oxide (N~2~O) and halogenated species to the total effective
    radiative forcing (ERF) increase since 1850 and 1960, and for 2000
    to 2009**. ERF data are taken from Annex III (based on calculations
    from Chapter 7). Note that the sum of the ERFs exceeds 100% because
    there are negative ERFs due to aerosols and clouds. Further details
    on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data
    table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.18 HERE\] **

Atmospheric abundance of GHGs is proportional to their emissions-loss
budgets in the Earth’s environment. There are multiple metrics to
evaluate the relative importance of different GHGs for the global
atmospheric radiation budget and the socio-economic impacts (Section
7.6). Metrics for weighting emissions are further developed in AR6
WGIII. Figure 5.19 shows the regional emissions of the three main GHGs.
For East Asia, Europe, Temperate North America and West Asia, the most
dominant GHG source is CO~2~ (*high confidence*) (Figure 5.19) while,
for East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tropical South America,
Temperate North America and Central Africa, the source is CH~4~ (Figure
5.19). The N~2~O emissions are dominant in regions with intense use of
nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. Only boreal North America showed
net sinks of CO~2~, while close to flux neutrality is observed for North
Asia, Southern Africa, and Australasia. Persistent emission of CO~2~ is
observed for Tropical and South America, northern Africa, and southeast
Asia (*medium confidence*). The *medium confidence* arises from large
uncertainties in the estimated non-fossil fuel CO~2~ fluxes over these
regions due to the lack of high-quality atmospheric measurements.

    methane (CH~4~), nitrous oxide (N~2~O) on the Earth’s surface.** The
    region divisions, shown as the shaded map, are made based on
    ecoclimatic characteristics of the land. The fluxes include those

    (feedbacks) as in the three budgets shown in Sections 5.2.1.5,
    5.2.2.5, and 5.2.3.5. The CH~4~ and N~2~O emissions are weighted by
    arbitrary factors of 50 and 500, respectively, for depiction by
    common y-axes. Fluxes are shown as the mean of the inverse models as
    available from Thompson et al. (2019); Friedlingstein et al. (2020);

Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation {#ocean-acidification-and-deoxygenation .AR6Chap5Level151}
-------------------------------------

The surface ocean has absorbed a quarter of all anthropogenic CO~2~
emissions, mainly through physical-chemical processes (McKinley et al.,
2016; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Once dissolved
in seawater, CO~2~ reacts with water and forms carbonic acid, which
dissociates, leading to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate
(CO~3~^-2^) ions, and increasing both bicarbonate (HCO~3~^-^) and
hydrogen (H^+^) ion concentration. This process has caused a shift in
the carbonate chemistry towards a less basic state, commonly referred to
as ‘ocean acidification’ (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Orr et al., 2005;
Doney et al., 2009). Although the societal concern for this problem­­­
is relatively recent (about the last 20 years), the physical-chemical
basis for the ocean absorption (sink) of atmospheric CO~2~ has been
discussed much earlier by Revelle and Suess (1957). The AR5 and SROCC
assessments were of *robust evidence* that the H^+^ ion concentration is
increasing in the surface ocean, thereby reducing seawater pH (= -
log\[H^+^\]) (Section 2.3.4.1; Orr et al., 2005; Feely et al., 2009;
Ciais et al., 2013; Bindoff et al., 2019), and there is *high
confidence* that ocean acidification is impacting marine organisms
(Bindoff et al., 2019).

Ocean oxygen decline, or deoxygenation, is driven by changes in ocean
ventilation and solubility (Bindoff et al., 2019). It is *virtually
certain* that anthropogenic forcing has made a substantial contribution
to the ocean heat content increase over the historical period (Bindoff
et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c; Chapter 9, Section 2.3.3.1), strengthening
upper water column stratification. Ocean warming decreases the
solubility of dissolved oxygen in seawater, and it contributes to about
15% of the dissolved oxygen decrease in the oceans according to
estimates based on solubility and the recent SROCC assessment (*medium
confidence*), especially in sub-surface waters, between 100–600 m depth
(Helm et al., 2011; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018;
Oschlies et al., 2018; SROCC, Section 5.3.1). Stratification reduces the
ventilation flux into the ocean interior, contributing to most of the
remaining ocean deoxygenation (Schmidtko et al., 2017; Breitburg et al.,
2018; Section 3.6.2). Deoxygenation may enhance the emissions of nitrous
oxide, especially from oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) or hypoxic coastal
areas (Breitburg et al., 2018; Oschlies et al., 2018). Since SROCC
(Bindoff et al., 2019), CMIP6 model simulation results agree with the
reported 2% loss (4.8 ± 2.1 Pmoles O~2~) in total dissolved oxygen in
the upper ocean layer (100–600 m) for the 1970–2010 period (Helm et al.,
2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al.,
2020; Section 2.3.4.2). The response of marine organisms to the coupled
effects of ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation occur at
different metabolic levels on different groups, and include respiratory
stress and reduction of thermal tolerance (Gruber, 2011; Bindoff et al.,
2019; IPCC, 2019c; Kawahata et al., 2019). An assessment of these
effects on marine biota is found in WGII AR6 Chapter 2⁠.

This section assesses past events of ocean acidification and
deoxygenation (Section 5.3.1), the historical trends and spatial
variability for the upper ocean (Section 5.3.2) and the ocean interior
(Section 5.3.3). Future projections for ocean acidification and the
drivers in the coastal ocean are assessed in Sections 5.3.4 and 5.3.5,
respectively.

### Paleoclimate Context {#paleoclimate-context .AR6Chap5Level2511}

1.  []{#_Toc70535676 .anchor}Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum

The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was an episode of global
warming exceeding pre-industrial temperatures by 4°C–8°C (McInerney and
Wing, 2011; Dunkley Jones et al., 2013) that occurred 55.9–55.7 Ma. The
PETM involved a large pulse of geologic CO~2~ released into the
ocean–atmosphere system in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al.,
2017; Kirtland Turner et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich,
2019; Section 5.2.1.1). In response, observationally constrained model
simulations report an increase in atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations
ranging from about 900 ppm to &gt;2000 ppm (Chapter 2; Gutjahr et al.,
2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Anagnostou et al., 2020). The PETM thus
provides a test for our understanding of the ocean’s response to the
increase in carbon (and heat) emissions over geologically short time
scales.

A limited number of independent proxy records indicate that the PETM was
associated with a surface ocean pH decline ranging from 0.15 to 0.30
units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al.,
2018)*.* It was also accompanied by a rapid (&lt;10 ka) shallowing of
the carbonate saturation horizon, resulting in the widespread
dissolution of sedimentary carbonate, followed by a gradual (100 kyr)
recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Bralower et al., 2018). The remarkable
similarity among sedimentary records spanning a wide range of ecosystems
suggests with *medium confidence* that the perturbation in the ocean
carbonate saturation was global (Babila et al., 2018) and directly
resulted from elevated atmospheric CO~2~ levels. The degree of
acidification is similar to the 0.4 pH unit decrease projected for the
end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015) and is
estimated to have occurred at a rate about one order of magnitude slower
than the current rate of ocean acidification (Zeebe et al., 2016). There
is *low confidence* in the inferred rates of ocean acidification
inherent to the range of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based
on marine sediments (Section 5.1.2.1).

Recent model outputs and globally distributed geochemical data reveal
with *medium confidence* widespread ocean deoxygenation during the PETM
(Dickson et al., 2012, 2014; Winguth et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2018;
Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean potentially becoming
drastically oxygen-depleted (anoxic; Yao et al., 2018; Clarkson et al.,
2021). Deoxygenation affected the surface ocean globally (including the
Arctic Ocean; Sluijs et al., 2006), due to vertical and lateral
expansion of OMZs (Zhou et al., 2014) that resulted from warming and
related changes in ocean stratification*.* Expansion of OMZs may have
stimulated N~2~O production through water-column (de)nitrification
(Junium et al., 2018). The degree to which N~2~O production impacted
PETM warming, however, has not yet been established.

The feedbacks associated with recovery from the PETM are uncertain, yet
could include drawdown associated with silicate weathering (Zachos et
al., 2005) and regrowth of terrestrial and marine organic carbon stocks
(Bowen and Zachos, 2010; Gutjahr et al., 2017).

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535677 .anchor}]{#_Toc5716932 .anchor}Last Deglacial
    Transition

The Last Deglacial Transition (LDT) is the best documented climatic
transition in the past associated with a substantial atmospheric CO~2~
rise ranging from 190 to 265 ppm between 18–11 ka (Marcott et al.,
2014). The amplitude of the deglacial CO~2~ rise is thus the same order
of magnitude as the increase since the Industrial Revolution.

Boron isotope (δ^11^B) data suggest a 0.15–0.05 unit decrease in sea
surface pH[]{#_Hlk74842705 .anchor} (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Henehan
et al., 2013) across the LDT, an average rate of decline of about 0.002
units per century compared with the current rate of more than 0.1 units
per century (Bopp et al., 2013; Gattuso et al., 2015). Planktonic
foraminiferal shell weights decreased by 40% to 50% (Barker and
Elderfield, 2002), and coccolith mass decreased by about 25% (Beaufort
et al., 2011) across the LDT. Independent proxy reconstructions thus
highlight with *high confidence* that pH values decreased as atmospheric
CO~2~ concentrations increased across the LDT. There is, however, *low
confidence* in the inferred rate of ocean acidification owing to
multiple sources of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based on
marine sediments (Section 5.1.2.1).

Geochemical and micropaleontological evidence suggest that
intermediate-depth OMZs almost vanished during the Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM) (Jaccard et al., 2014). However, multiple lines of evidence
suggest with *medium confidence* that the deep (&gt;1500 m) ocean became
depleted in O~2~ (concentrations were possibly lower than 50 μmol
kg^–1^) globally []{#_Hlk70175445 .anchor}(Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012;
Hoogakker et al., 2015, 2018; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; Anderson et
al., 2019) as a combined result of sluggish ventilation of the ocean
subsurface (Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; Skinner et al., 2017) and a
generally more efficient marine biological carbon pump (Buchanan et al.,
2016; Yamamoto et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020).

During the LDT, deep ocean ventilation increased as Antarctic Bottom
Water (AABW) (Skinner et al., 2010; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Jaccard et
al., 2016) and subsequently the Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation (McManus et al., 2004; Lippold et al., 2016) resumed,
transferring previously sequestered remineralized carbon from the ocean
interior to the upper ocean, and eventually the atmosphere (Skinner et
al., 2010; Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Ronge
et al., 2016; Sikes et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; Ronge et al., 2020),
contributing to the deglacial CO~2~ rise. Intermediate depths lost
oxygen as a result of sluggish ventilation and increasing temperatures
(decreasing saturation). As the world emerged from the last Glacial
period, OMZs underwent a large volumetric increase at the beginning of
the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), a northern-hemisphere wide warming event,
14.7 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Praetorius et al., 2015) with
deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems (e.g., Moffitt et al.,
2015). These observations indicate with *high confidence* that the rate
of warming, affecting the solubility of oxygen and upper water column
stratification, coupled with changes in subsurface ocean ventilation,
impose a direct control on the degree of ocean deoxygenation, implying a
high sensitivity of ocean oxygen loss to warming. The expansion of OMZs
contributed to a widespread increase in water column (de)nitrification
[]{#_Hlk74842929 .anchor}(Galbraith et al., 2013), which contributed
substantially to enhanced marine N~2~O emissions (Schilt et al., 2014;
Fischer et al., 2019). Nitrogen stable isotope measurements on N~2~O
extracted from ice cores suggest that approximately one-third (of the
order of 0.7 ± 0.3 TgN yr^–1^) of the deglacial increase in N~2~O
emissions relates to oceanic sources (Schilt et al., 2014; Fischer et
al., 2019).

### Historical Trends and Spatial Characteristics in the Upper Ocean {#historical-trends-and-spatial-characteristics-in-the-upper-ocean .AR6Chap5Level2511}

1.  []{#_Toc70535679 .anchor}Reconstructed Centennial Ocean
    Acidification Trends

Ocean pH time series are based on the reconstruction of coral boron
isotope ratios (δ^11^B). A majority of coral δ^11^B data have been
generated from the western Pacific region with a few records from the
Atlantic Ocean. Biweekly resolution paleo-pH records show monsoonal
variation of about 0.5 pH unit in the South China Sea (Liu et al.,
2014). Interannual ocean pH variability in the range of 0.07–0.16 pH
unit characterizes southwest Pacific corals that are attributed to El
Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) (H.C. Wu et al., 2018) and river runoff
(D’Olivo et al., 2015). Decadal (10-, 22- and 48-year) ocean pH
variations in the southwest Pacific have been linked to the Interdecadal
Pacific Oscillation, causing variations of up to 0.30 pH unit in the
Great Barrier Reef (Pelejero et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2009) but weaker
(about 0.08 pH unit) in the open ocean (H.C. Wu et al., 2018). Decadal
variations in the South China Sea pH changes of 0.10–0.20 have also been
associated with the variation in the East Asian monsoon (Liu et al.,
2014; Wei et al., 2015), as a weakening of the Asian winter monsoon
leads to sluggish water circulation within the reefs, building up
localised CO~2~ concentration in the water due to calcification and
respiration.

Since the beginning of the industrial period in the mid-19th century,
coral δ^11^B-derived ocean pH has decreased by 0.06–0.24 pH unit in the
South China Sea (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015) and 0.12 pH unit in
the southwest Pacific (H.C. Wu et al., 2018). Since the mid-20th
century, a distinct feature of coral δ^11^B records relates to ocean
acidification trends, albeit having a wide range of values: 0.12–0.40 pH
unit in the Great Barrier Reef (Wei et al., 2009; D’Olivo et al., 2015),
0.05–0.08 pH unit in the northwest Pacific (Shinjo et al., 2013) and
0.04–0.09 pH unit in the Atlantic Ocean (Goodkin et al., 2015; Fowell et
al., 2018). Concurrent coral carbon isotopic (δ^13^C) measurements infer
ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO~2~ from the combustion of fossil fuel,
based on the lower abundance of ^13^C in fossil fuel carbon. Western
Pacific coral records show depleted δ^13^C trends since the late 19th
century that are more prominent since the mid-20th century (*high
confidence*) []{#_Hlk74843175 .anchor}(Pelejero et al., 2005; Wei et
al., 2009; Shinjo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Kubota et al., 2017;
H.C. Wu et al., 2018).

Overall, many of the records show a highly variable seawater pH
underlaying strong imprints of internal climate variability (*high
confidence*) and, in most instances, superimposed on a decreasing δ^11^B
trend that is indicative of anthropogenic ocean acidification in recent
decades (*medium confidence*). The robustness of seawater pH
reconstructions is currently limited by the uncertainty on the
calibration of the δ^11^B proxy in different tropical coral species.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535680 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564267 .anchor}Observations of
    Ocean Acidification over Recent Decades

The SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3) indicated that it is *virtually certain*
that the ocean has undergone acidification globally in response to ocean
CO~2~ uptake, and concluded that pH in open ocean surface water has
changed by a *virtually certain* range of –0.017 to –0.027 pH units per
decade since the late 1980s. Since SROCC, evidence of the progress of
acidification across all regions of the oceans has been further
strengthened by continued observations of seawater carbonate chemistry
at ocean time series stations, and compiled shipboard studies providing
temporally resolved and methodologically consistent datasets (Jiang et
al., 2019) (Figure 5.20; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Section
2.3.3.5).

In the subtropical open oceans, decreases in pH have been reported with
a *very* *likely* rate range, from –0.016 to –0.019 pH units per decade
since 1980s, which equates to approximately 4 % increase in hydrogen ion
concentration (\[H^+^\]) per decade. Accordingly, the saturation state Ω
(=\[Ca^2+^\]\[CO~3~^2-^\]/*K*~sp~) of seawater with respect to calcium
carbonate mineral aragonite has been declining at rates ranging from
–0.07 to –0.12 per decade (González-Dávila et al., 2010; Feely et al.,
2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Ono et al., 2019;
Bates and Johnson, 2020; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3). This is
consistent with the rates expected from the transient equilibration with
increasing atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations, but the variability of rate
in decadal time scale has also been detected with *robust evidence* (Ono
et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020). In the tropical Pacific, its
central and eastern upwelling zones exhibited a faster pH decline of
–0.022 to –0.026 pH unit per decade due to increased upwelling of
CO~2~-rich sub-surface waters in addition to anthropogenic CO~2~ uptake
(Sutton et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015). By contrast, warm pools in
the western tropical Pacific exhibited slower pH decline of –0.010 to
–0.013 pH unit per decade (Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Lauvset
et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020). Observational and modelling studies
(Nakano et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020) consistently suggest that
slower acidification in this region is attributable to the anthropogenic
CO~2~ taken up in the extratropics around a decade ago and transported
to the tropics via shallow meridional overturning circulations.

In open subpolar and polar zones, the *very likely* range (–0.003 to
–0.026 pH unit per decade) and uncertainty (up to 0.010) observed in pH
decline are larger than in the subtropics, reflecting the complex
interplay between physical and biological forcing mechanisms (Olafsson
et al., 2009; Midorikawa et al., 2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et
al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015; Wakita et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the
*high agreement* of pH decline among these available time-series studies
leads to *high confidence* in the trend of acidification in these zones.
In the Arctic Ocean, a temporally limited time series of carbonate
chemistry measurements prevents drawing robust conclusions on ocean
acidification trends. However, the carbonate saturation state (Ω) is
generally low, and observational studies show with *robust evidence*
that the recent extensive melting of sea ice leading to enhanced air-sea
CO~2~ exchange, large freshwater inputs, together with river discharge
and glacial drainage, as well as the degradation of terrestrial organic
matter in seawater, result in the decline of Ω of aragonite to
undersaturation (Bates et al., 2009; Chierici and Fransson, 2009;
Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010; Robbins et al.,
2013; Fransson et al., 2015; Semiletov et al., 2016; Anderson et al.,
2017; Qi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020; Beaupré-Laperrière et al.,
2020; SROCC Section 3.2.1.2.4, IPCC, 2019b). The low saturation state of
aragonite (Ω about 1) has also been observed in surface waters of the
Antarctic coastal zone associated with freshwater input from glaciers
(Mattsdotter Björk et al., 2014) and upwelling of deep water (Hauri et
al., 2015) as well as along eastern boundary upwelling systems (Feely et
al., 2016).

Overall, in agreement with SROCC, it is *virtually certain* from these
observational studies that ocean surface waters undergo acidification
globally with the CO~2~ increase in the atmosphere. These sustained
measurements over the past decades, and campaign studies of ocean
carbonate chemistry, also highlight with *robust evidence* that trends
of acidification have been modulated by the variability and changes in
physical and chemical states of ocean, including those affected by the
warming of the cryosphere, and need to be better understood.

    .anchor}Ocean Memory: Acidification in the Ocean Interior

Advances in observations and modelling for ocean physics and
biogeochemistry and established knowledge of ocean carbonate chemistry
show with *very high confidence* that anthropogenic CO~2~ taken up into
the ocean surface layer is further spreading into the ocean interior
through ventilation processes, including vertical mixing, diffusion,
subduction and meridional overturning circulations (Sections 2.3.3.5,
5.2.1.3 and 9.2.2.3; Sallée et al., 2012; Bopp et al., 2015; Nakano et
al., 2015; Iudicone et al., 2016; Toyama et al., 2017; Perez et al.,
2018; Gruber et al., 2019b) and is causing acidification in the ocean
interior. The net change in oxygen consumption by aerobic respiration of
marine organisms further influences acidification by releasing CO~2~
(Section 5.3.3.2; Chen et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Robinson,
2019).

Observations over past decades of basin-wide and global syntheses of
ocean interior carbon show that the extent of acidification due to
anthropogenic CO~2~ invasion tends to diminish with depth (*very high
confidence*) (Section 5.2.1.3.3 and Figure 5.21; []{#_Hlk74844480
.anchor}Woosely et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2017a; Lauvset et al.,
2020). The regions of deep convection such as subpolar North Atlantic
and Southern Ocean present the deepest acidification detections below
2000 m (*medium confidence*). Mid-latitudinal zones within the
subtropical cells and tropical regions present a relatively deep and
shallow detection, respectively. A pH decrease has also been observed on
the Antarctic continental shelf (Hauck et al., 2010; Williams et al.,
2015). Acidification is also underway in the subsurface to intermediate
layers of the Arctic Ocean due to the inflow of ventilated waters from
the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (Qi et al., 2017; Ulfsbo et
al., 2018).

    chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.21 HERE\] **

A significant increase in acidification resulting from net metabolic
CO~2~ release coupled with ocean circulation changes has been shown with
*high confidence* in large swathes of intermediate waters in the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans (Dore et al., 2009; Byrne et al., 2010; Rios et al.,
2015; Chu et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2017b; Lauvset et al., 2020). For
example, ocean circulation contributes a pH change of –0.013 ± 0.013 to
the overall observed change of –0.029 ± 0.014 for 1993–2013 at depths
around 1000 m at 30°S–40°S in the South Atlantic ocean (Ríos et al.,
2015). Long-term repeated observations in the North Pacific show a
decline in dissolved oxygen (–4.0 μmol kg^−1^ per decade at maximum)
being sustained in the intermediate water since the 1980s (Takatani et
al., 2012; Sasano et al., 2015). The amplification of acidification
associated with the weakening ventilation is thought to have been
occurring persistently. In contrast, for the North Pacific subtropical
mode water, large decadal variability in pH and aragonite saturation
state with amplitudes of about 0.02 and about 0.1, respectively, are
superimposed on secular declining trends due to anthropogenic CO~2~
invasion (Oka et al., 2019). This is associated with the variability in
ventilation due to the approximately 50% variation in the formation
volume of the mode water that is forced remotely by the Pacific decadal
oscillation (Qiu et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2015).

These trends of acidification in the ocean interior lead to *high
confidence* in shoaling of the saturation horizons of calcium carbonate
minerals where Ω = 1. In the Pacific Ocean where the aragonite
saturation horizon is shallower (a few hundred metres to 1200 m; Figure
5.21c), the rate of its shoaling is in the order of 1–2 m yr^–1^ (Feely
et al., 2012; Ross et al., 2020). In contrast, shoaling rates of 4 m
yr^–1^ to 1710 m for 1984–2008 and of 10–15 m yr^–1^ to 2250 m for
1991–2016 have been observed in the Iceland sea and the Irminger sea,
respectively (Olafsson et al., 2009; Perez et al., 2018).

In summary, ocean acidification is spreading into the ocean interior.
Its rates at depths are controlled by the ventilation of the ocean
interior as well as anthropogenic CO~2~ uptake at the surface, thereby
diminishing with depth (*very high confidence*) (Figure 5.21).
Variability in ocean circulation modulates the trend of ocean
acidification at depths through the changes in ventilation and their
impacts on metabolic CO~2~ content. However, the large knowledge gap
around ventilation changes leads to *low confidence* in their impacts in
many ocean regions (Sections 5.3.3.2; 9.2.2.3 and 9.3.2).

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535683 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564271 .anchor}Ocean
    Deoxygenation and its Implications for Greenhouse Gases

As summarizsed in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4), there is a growing consensus
that between 1970 and 2010 the open ocean has *very likely* lost
0.5–3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000 m depth (Section
2.3.3.6 ; Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017;
Bindoff et al., 2019). Regionally, the equatorial and North Pacific, the
Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic have shown the greatest oxygen
loss of up to 30 mol m^–2^ per decade (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Warming
– via solubility reduction and circulation changes – mixing and
respiration are considered the major drivers, with 50% of the oxygen
loss for the upper 1000 m of the global oceans attributable to the
solubility reduction (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Climate variability also
modifies the oxygen loss on interannual and decadal time scales
especially for the tropical ocean OMZs (Deutsch et al., 2011, 2014;
Llanillo et al., 2013) and the North Pacific subarctic zone (Whitney et
al., 2007; Sasano et al., 2018; Cummins and Ross, 2020). However,
quantifying the oxygen decline and variability and attributing them to
processes in different regions remains challenging (Oschlies et al.,
2018; Levin, 2018). Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP5 and CMIP6
corroborate the decline in ocean oxygen, and project a continuing and
accelerating decline with a strong impact of natural climate variability
under high-emission scenarios []{#_Hlk74844841 .anchor}(Bopp et al.,
2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Long et al., 2016). However, CMIP5
models did not reproduce observed patterns for oxygen changes in the
tropical thermocline, and generally simulated only about half the oxygen
loss inferred from observations (Oschlies et al., 2018). CMIP6 models
have a more realistic simulated mean state of ocean biogeochemistry than
CMIP5 models due to improved ocean physical processes and better
representation of biogeochemical processes (Séférian et al., 2020). They
also exhibit enhanced ocean warming as a result of an increase in the
equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 models,
which contributes to increased stratification and reduced subsurface
ventilation (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.4, 5.3.3.2, 7.4.2, 7.5.6 and 9.2.1, and
TS2.4). Consequently, CMIP6 model ensembles reproduce the ocean
deoxygenation trend of −0.30 to −1.52 mmol m^−3^ per decade between
1970–2010 reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4) with a *very likely*
range, and also project 32–71 % greater subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen
decline relative to their RCP analogues in CMIP5, reaching to the
*likely* range of decline of 6.4 ± 2.9 mmol m^–3^ under SSP1–2.6 and
13.3 ± 5.3 mmol m^–3^ under SSP5-8.5, from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099.
However, they also exhibit enhanced surface ocean warming as a result of
an increased ECS, which contributes to greater reduction in subsurface
ventilation. Consequently, CMIP6 model ensembles now reproduce the
recent observed historical ocean deoxygenation trend of −0.30 to
−1.52 mmol m^–3^ per decade between 1970–2010 reported in SROCC (Section
5.2.2.4) within a 90% confidence range, but project 32–71 % greater
subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline relative to their RCP analogues in
CMIP5, reaching to the *likely* range of decline of 6.4 ± 2.9 mmol m^–3^
under SSP1-2.6 and 13.3 ± 5.3 mmol m^–3^ under SSP5-8.5, from 1870–1899
to 2080–2099 due to increased warming (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). It is
concluded that the oxygen content of subsurface ocean is projected to
transition to historically unprecedented conditions with decline over
the 21st century (*medium confidence*).

In oxygen-depleted waters, microbial processes (denitrification and
anammox, i.e., anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Kuypers et al., 2005;
Codispoti, 2007; Gruber and Galloway, 2008) remove fixed nitrogen, and
when upwelled waters reach the photic zone, primary production becomes
nitrogen-limited (Tyrrell and Lucas, 2002). However, in other oceanic
regions, increased water-column stratification due to warming may reduce
the amount of N~2~O reaching the surface and thereby decrease N~2~O flux
to the atmosphere. Landolfi et al. (2017) suggest that, by 2100, under
the RCP8.5 scenario, total N~2~O production in the ocean may decline by
5% and N~2~O emissions be reduced by 24% relative to the pre-industrial
era due to decreased organic matter export and anthropogenic-driven
changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric N~2~O concentrations.
Projected oxygen loss in the ocean is thought to result in an
ocean-climate feedback through changes in the natural emission of GHGs
(*low confidence*).

The areas with relatively rapid oxygen decrease include OMZs in the
tropical oceans, where oxygen content has been decreasing at a rate of
0.9–3.4 µmol kg^–1^ per decade in the thermocline for the past five
decades []{#__Fieldmark__1005_1648232024 .anchor}(Stramma et al., 2008).
Low oxygen, low pH and shallow aragonite saturation horizons in the OMZs
of the eastern boundary upwelling regions co-occur, affecting ecosystem
structure (Chavez et al., 2008) and function in the water column,
including the presently unbalanced nitrogen cycle (Paulmier and
Ruiz-Pino, 2009). The coupling between upwelling, productivity, and
oxygen depletion feeds back to biological productivity and the role of
these regions as sinks or sources of climate active gases. When OMZ
waters upwell and impinge on the euphotic zone, they release significant
quantities of GHGs, including N~2~O (0.81–1.35 TgN yr^–1^), CH~4~
(0.27–0.38 TgCH~4~ yr^–1^), and CO~2~ (yet to be quantified) to the
atmosphere, exacerbating global warming (Paulmier et al., 2008; Naqvi et
al., 2010; Kock et al., 2012; Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et
al., 2015; Farías et al., 2015).[]{#_Hlk4259520 .anchor} Modelling
projections suggest a global decrease of 4–12% in oceanic N~2~O
emissions (from 3.71–4.03 TgN yr^–1^ to 3.54–3.56 TgN yr^–1^) from 2005
to 2100 under RCP8.5, despite a tendency to increased N~2~O production
in the OMZs, associated primarily with denitrification (Martinez-Rey et
al., 2015). It is difficult to single out the contribution of
nitrification and denitrification, which can occur simultaneously. A
rigorous separation of these two processes would require more
mechanistic parametrization, which has been hindered by the large
conceptual and parametric uncertainties (Babbin et al., 2015; Trimmer et
al., 2016; Landolfi et al., 2017). Furthermore, the correlation between
N~2~O and oxygen varies with microorganisms present, nutrient
concentrations, and other environmental variables (Voss et al., 2013).

In summary, total oceanic N~2~O emissions were projected to decline by
4–12% from 2005–2100 (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015) and by 24% from the
pre-industrial era to 2100 (Landolfi et al., 2017) under RCP8.5.
However, there is *low confidence* in the reduction in N~2~O emission to
the atmosphere, because of large conceptual and parametric
uncertainties, a limited number of modelling studies that explored this
process, and greater oxygen losses simulated in CMIP6 models than in
CMIP5 models (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).

### Future Projections for Ocean Acidification {#future-projections-for-ocean-acidification .AR6Chap5Level2511}

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535685 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564272 .anchor}Future Projections
    with Earth System Models (ESMs)

Projections with CMIP5 ESMs, reported in AR5 (Section 6.4.4) and SROCC
(Section 5.2.2.3; IPCC, 2019b), showed changes in global mean surface
ocean pH from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 of -0.14 ± 0.001 (inter-model
standard deviation) under RCP2.6 and –0.38 ±0.005 under RCP8.5 with
pronounced regional variability (Bopp et al., 2013; Hurd et al., 2018).
They also projected faster pH declines in mode waters below seasonal
mixed layers (Resplandy et al., 2013; Watanabe and Kawamiya, 2017) as
has been observed in the Atlantic (Salt et al., 2015) and in the Pacific
(Carter et al., 2019), because of the net CO~2~ release by respiration
and lowering CO~2~ buffering capacity of seawater. In these CO~2~
concentration-driven simulations, the level of acidification in the
surface ocean is primarily determined by atmospheric CO~2~ concentration
and regional seawater carbonate chemistry, thereby providing consistent
projections across models. New projections with CMIP6 ESMs show greater
surface pH decline of -0.16 ± 0.002 under the SSP1-2.6 and –0.44 ± 0.005
under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 (Section 4.3.2.5 and
Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The greater pH
declines in CMIP6 are primarily a consequence of higher atmospheric
CO~2~ concentrations in SSPs than their CMIP5-RCP analogues (Kwiatkowski
et al., 2020). Ocean acidification is also projected to occur with *high
confidence* in the Abyssal Bottom Waters in regions such as the northern
North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean (Sulpis et al., 2019), with the
rates of global mean pH decline of –0.018 ±0.001 under SSP1-2.6 and
–0.030 ± 0.002 under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 in CMIP6
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).

In surface ocean, changes in the amplitude of seasonal variations in pH
are also projected to occur with *high confidence.* ESMs in CMIP6 show
+73 ± 12% increase in the amplitude of seasonal variation in hydrogen
ion concentration (\[H^+^\]) but 10 ± 5% decrease in the seasonal
variation in pH (= -log \[H^+^\]) from 1995–2014 to 2080–2099 under
SSP5-8.5. The simultaneous amplification of \[H^+^\] and attenuation of
pH seasonal cycles is counterintuitive but is the consequence of a
greater increase in the annual mean \[H^+^\] due to anthropogenic CO~2~
invasion than the corresponding increase in its seasonal amplitude.
These changes are consistent with the amplification/attenuation of the
seasonal variation of +81 ±16% for \[H^+^\] and –16 ± 7% for pH from
1990–1999 to 2090–2099 under RCP8.5 in CMIP5 (Kwiatkowski and Orr,
2018).

The signal of ocean acidification in surface ocean is large and is
projected to emerge beyond the range of natural variability within the
time scale of a decade in all ocean basins (Schlunegger et al., 2019).
There is *high agreement* among modelling studies that the largest pH
decline and large-scale undersaturation of aragonite in surface seawater
start to occur first in polar oceans (Orr et al., 2005; Steinacher et
al., 2009; Hurd et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). Under SSP5-8.5, the
largest surface pH decline, exceeding 0.45 between 1995–2014 and
2080–2099, occurs in the Arctic Ocean (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The
freshwater input from sea ice melt is an additional factor leading to a
faster decline of aragonite saturation level than expected from the
anthropogenic CO~2~ uptake (Yamamoto et al., 2012). The increase in
riverine and glacial discharges that provide terrigenous carbon,
nutrients and alkalinity as well as freshwater are the other factors
modifying the rate of acidification in the Arctic Ocean. However, their
impacts have been projected in a limited number of studies with
extensive knowledge gaps and model simplifications leading to *low
confidence* in their impacts (Terhaar et al., 2019; Hopwood et al.,
2020). In the Southern Ocean, the aragonite undersaturation starts in
2030 in RCP8.5, and the area that experiences aragonite undersaturation
for at least one month per year by 2100 is projected to be more than
95%. Under RCP2.6, short periods (&lt;1 month) of aragonite
undersaturation are expected to be found in less than 2% of the area
during this century (Sasse et al., 2015; Hauri et al., 2016;
Negrete-García et al., 2019). These long term projections are modified
at interannual time scales by large-scale climate modes (Ríos et al.,
2015) such as the ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (Conrad and
Lovenduski, 2015). In other regions, acidification trends are influenced
by a range of processes such as changes in ocean circulation,
temperature, salinity, carbon cycling, and the structure of the marine
ecosystem. As, at present, models do not resolve fine-scale variability
of these processes, current projections do not fully capture the changes
that the marine environment will experience in the future (Takeshita et
al., 2015; Turi et al., 2016).

Overall, with the rise of atmospheric CO~2~, the physics of CO~2~
transfer across the air-sea interface, the carbonate chemistry in
seawater, the trends of ocean acidification being observed in the past
decades (Section 5.3.3.2) and modelling studies described in this
section, it is *virtually certain* that ocean acidification will
continue to grow. However, the magnitude and sign of many of ocean
carbon–climate feedbacks are still poorly constrained (Matear and
Lenton, 2014, 2018), leading to *low confidence* in their significant
and long-lasting impacts on ocean acidification.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535686 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564273 .anchor}Reversal of Ocean
    Acidification by Carbon Dioxide Removal

Reversing the increase in atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations through
negative emissions (Section 5.6) will reverse ocean acidification at the
sea surface but will not result in rapid amelioration of ocean
acidification in the deeper ocean (Section 5.3.3.2). The ocean’s uptake
of atmospheric CO~2~ will start to decrease as atmospheric CO~2~
decreases (Sections 5.4.5, 5.4.10 and 5.6.2.1; Mathesius et al., 2015;
Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015) However, because of the long time scales of
the ocean turnover that transfers CO~2~ from the upper to the deep
ocean, excess carbon will continue to accumulate in the deep ocean even
after a decrease in atmospheric CO~2~ (Cao et al., 2014; Mathesius et
al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Li et al., 2020). There is thus
*high confidence* that CO~2~ emissions leave a long-term legacy in ocean
acidification, and are therefore irreversible at multi-human
generational scales, even with aggressive atmospheric CO~2~ removal.

### Coastal Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation {#coastal-ocean-acidification-and-deoxygenation .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The coastal ocean, from the shoreline to the isobath of 200 m, is highly
heterogeneous due to the complex interplay between physical,
biogeochemical and anthropogenic factors (Gattuso et al., 1998; Chen and
Borges, 2009; Dürr et al., 2011; Laruelle et al., 2014; McCormack et
al., 2016). These areas, according to SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) are,
with *high confidence*, already affected by ocean acidification and
deoxygenation. This section assesses the drivers and spatial variability
of acidification and deoxygenation based on new observations and data
products.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535688 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564275 .anchor}Drivers

Observations and data products including models (Astor et al., 2013;
Bakker et al., 2016; Kosugi et al., 2016; Vargas et al., 2016; Laruelle
et al., 2017, 2018; Orselli et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2019; Cai et
al., 2020; H. Sun et al., 2020) confirm the strong spatial and temporal
variability in the coastal ocean surface carbonate chemistry and sea-air
CO~2~ fluxes (*high agreement*, *robust evidence*). The anthropogenic
CO~2~-induced acidification is either mitigated or enhanced through
biological processes; primary production removes dissolved CO~2~ from
the surface, and respiration adds CO~2~ and consumes oxygen in the
subsurface layers. The relative intensity of these processes is
controlled by natural or anthropogenic eutrophication. Other drivers of
variability include biological community composition, freshwater input
from rivers or melting ice, sea ice cover and calcium carbonate
precipitation/dissolution dynamics, coastal upwelling and regional
circulation, and seasonal surface cooling (Fransson et al., 2015, 2017;
Feely et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Hauri et
al., 2020; Monteiro et al., 2020b; H. Sun et al., 2020). Near-shore
surface waters are often supersaturated with CO~2~, regardless of the
latitude, especially in highly populated areas receiving substantial
amounts of domestic and industrial sewage (Chen and Borges, 2009)⁠.
Nevertheless, thermal or haline-stratified eutrophic coastal areas may
act as net atmospheric CO~2~ sinks (Chou et al., 2013; Cotovicz Jr. et
al., 2015). Continental shelves, excluding near-shore areas, act as
CO~2~ sinks at a rate of 0.2 ± 0.02 PgC yr^–1^ (Laruelle et al., 2014;
Roobaert et al., 2019), considering ice-free areas only. Under
increasing atmospheric CO~2~ and eutrophication, such ecosystems would
be more vulnerable to ecological and seawater chemistry changes,
impacting the local economy.

Since AR5, (Ciais et al., 2013) and in agreement with SROCC (IPCC,
2019b), there is now *high agreement* (*robust evidence*) that coastal
ocean acidification, whether induced only by increasing atmospheric
CO~2~ or exacerbated by eutrophication or upwelling, has negative
effects on specific groups of marine organisms such as reef-building
corals, crabs, pteropods, and sessile fauna (AR6 WGII, Chapter 3; Dupont
et al., 2010; Bindoff et al., 2019; Bednaršek et al., 2020; Osborne et
al., 2020), especially when combined with stressors such as temperature
and deoxygenation, and potentially increased bioavailability of toxic
elements such as arsenic and copper (Millero et al., 2009; Boyd et al.,
2015; Breitburg et al., 2018).

Since SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019), there is further evidence that
anthropogenic eutrophication via continental runoff and atmospheric
nutrient deposition, and ocean warming are *very likely* the main
drivers of deoxygenation in coastal areas (Levin and Breitburg, 2015;
Levin et al., 2015; Royer et al., 2016; Breitburg et al., 2018;
Cocquempot et al., 2019; Fagundes et al., 2020; Limburg et al., 2020).
Increasing intensity and frequency of wind-driven upwelling is
responsible for longer and more intense coastal hypoxia, fuelled by
organic matter degradation from primary production *(medium to high
agreement, medium evidence)* (Rabalais et al., 2010; Bakun et al., 2015;
Varela et al., 2015; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Limburg et al., 2020).
Locally, submarine groundwater discharge may enhance the eutrophication
state (*low agreement, limited evidence*, Luijendijk et al., 2020).
Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) and SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) new
observations and model studies confirm the trends in increasing coastal
hypoxia caused by eutrophication, ocean warming and changes in
circulation (Claret et al., 2018; Dussin et al., 2019; Limburg et al.,
2020), as well as the ubiquitous impacts on marine organisms and
fisheries (WGII Chapter 3; Carstensen and Conley, 2019; Fennel and
Testa, 2019; Osma et al., 2020). Following open ocean deoxygenation
trends since the 1950s, more than 700 coastal regions are being reported
as hypoxic (dissolved oxygen concentration &lt;2 mg O~2~ L^–1^) (Limburg
et al., 2020). Additionally, deoxygenation or increasing severe hypoxic
periods in coastal areas may enhance the sea-to-air fluxes of N~2~O and
CH~4~ especially through microbial-mediated processes in the water
column-sediment interface (*medium agreement*) (Middelburg and Levin,
2009; Naqvi et al., 2010; Farías et al., 2015; Limburg et al., 2020).

[]{#_Hlk51837567 .anchor}There is *high agreement* (*robust evidence*)
that heterogeneity implies different responses of coastal regions to
increasing atmospheric CO~2~, decreasing seawater pH and calcium
carbonate saturation state, and deoxygenation (Duarte et al., 2013;
Regnier et al., 2013b; Breitburg et al., 2018; Laruelle et al., 2018;
Carstensen and Duarte, 2019).

There is *high agreement* that long-time series of observations
utilizing standard methods are needed to distinguish the climate change
signal in seawater carbonate chemistry from the natural variability of
coastal sites (Duarte et al., 2013; Salisbury and Jönsson, 2018; IOC,
2019; Sutton et al., 2019; Tilbrook et al., 2019; Turk et al., 2019).
Despite the increasing availability of data and sea-air CO~2~ flux
budgets for the coastal ocean (Sections 5.3.5.1 and 5.2.3.1), additional
long-term observations are required to constrain the global time of
emergence of coastal acidification. There is *high agreement* (*medium
evidence*) that, for the coastal subtropical to temperate northeast
Pacific and northwest Atlantic, the mean time of emergence for
acidification is above two decades (Sutton et al., 2019; Turk et al.,
2019).

[]{#_Hlk63328873 .anchor}Observations and models predict an expansion
and intensification of low-pH deep water intrusions for the northeast
Pacific coastal upwelling area (*high agreement*, *robust evidence*)
(Hauri et al., 2013; Feely et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2020). Areas such
as the California Current System are naturally exposed to intrusions of
low‐pH, high pCO~2sea~ deep waters from remineralization processes and
anthropogenic CO~2~ intrusion (Feely et al., 2008, 2010, 2018; Chan et
al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020).The eastern Pacific
coastal upwelling displays seasonality in subsurface aragonite
undersaturation as a consequence of the interplay between anthropogenic
CO~2~, respiration and intrusion of upwelling waters (Feely et al.,
2008, 2010, 2016, 2018; Hauri et al., 2013; Vargas et al., 2016; Chan et
al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019). The coastal southeast Pacific upwelling
combined with low-pH, low-alkalinity, organic matter-rich river inputs
display extreme temporal variability in surface seawater *p*CO~2~ and
low aragonite saturation (Vargas et al., 2016; Osma et al., 2020).

Temperate, non-upwelling coastal areas along the northwest Atlantic
display a trend of decreasing seawater pH, mainly attributed to the
combined effects of eutrophication and decreasing seawater buffering
capacity (*high agreement*, *robust evidence*). Observations show an
increasing north to south gradient of aragonite saturation state (Sutton
et al., 2016; Fennel et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020). Low alkalinity and
total inorganic carbon concentration, combined with an ocean signal of
acidification, diminishes the buffering capacity along the decreasing
salinity gradient from the ocean to the coast. Models suggest that, in
this area, the aragonite saturation is seasonally controlled by nutrient
availability and primary production, supporting the suggestion that
eutrophication is the main driver for exacerbating acidification (Cai et
al., 2017, 2020). The coastal Gulf of Mexico is facing a parallel
increase in bottom water acidification and deoxygenation off the
Mississippi Delta driven by eutrophication (Cai et al., 2011; Laurent et
al., 2017; Fennel et al., 2019).

Many coastal tropical areas are under heavy anthropogenic eutrophication
induced by the effluents from large cities, or receive large riverine
inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and organic matter (such as Amazon,
Mississippi, Orinoco, Congo, Mekong, or Changjiang rivers). Under strong
eutrophication, often sub-surface and bottom waters present pH values
lower than average surface open ocean (about 8.0) because increased
respiration decreases pH (*high agreement*, *robust evidence*), despite
a net atmospheric CO~2~ sink in shallow and vertically stratified
coastal areas (Koné et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2014; Cotovicz Jr. et
al., 2015, 2018; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Lowe et al., 2019; Section
5.3.5.1).

There is *medium evidence* from observations and models that the coastal
northwestern Antarctic Peninsula (Southern Ocean) will experience
calcium carbonate undersaturation by 2060, considering that
anthropogenic emissions reach an atmospheric CO~2~ concentration of
about 500 pm at that date (Lencina-Avila et al., 2018; Monteiro et al.,
2020a). The synergies among warming, melt water, sea-air CO~2~
equilibrium and circulation may, to some extent, offset the coastal
ocean acidification trends in Antarctica (Henley et al., 2020). In the
coastal western Arctic Ocean, there is increasing *robust evidence* that
ocean acidification is driven by sea-air CO~2~ fluxes and sea-ice melt,
and increasing intrusions since the 1990s of low-alkalinity Pacific
water, lowering aragonite saturation state (Qi et al., 2017, 2020; Cross
et al., 2018). The Bering Sea (northeastern Pacific) shows decreasing
trends in calcium carbonate saturation, associated to the increasing
atmospheric CO~2~ uptake combined with riverine freshwater and carbon
inputs (*high agreement*, *robust evidence*) (Pilcher et al., 2019; H.
Sun et al., 2020).

[[]{#_Hlk51765111 .anchor}]{#_Hlk52553417 .anchor}The spatial
distribution of hypoxic areas is highly heterogeneous in the coastal
ocean, and there is *high agreement, robust evidence* that more severe

leading to an accumulation of organic matter in subsurface waters (Ciais
et al., 2013; Rabalais et al., 2014; M. Li et al., 2016; Breitburg et
al., 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; SROCC Chapter 5; IPCC, 2019b). The
causes and trends of coastal deoxygenation can only be assessed by
making available long-term time series combined with regional modelling
(Fennel and Testa, 2019), as in the California current system (Wang et
al., 2017), the East China Sea (Chen et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2017),
the Namibian or along the northwestern Atlantic shelves (Claret et al.,
2018). Other coastal upwelling sites such as the Arabian Sea display
seasonal hypoxia but no worsening trends (Gupta et al., 2016).

The Baltic Sea is the largest semi-enclosed sea where hypoxia is
reported to have happened before the 1950s (Carstensen et al., 2014;
Rabalais et al., 2014; Łukawska-Matuszewska et al., 2019). The frequency
and volume of seawater inflow from the North Sea decreased after 1950,
leading to an expansion of hypoxic areas from 40,000 to 60,000 km² in
combination with increasing eutrophication (Carstensen et al., 2014).
From the available observations, there is *robust evidence* that many
areas in the Baltic Sea are experiencing deoxygenation despite efforts
to reduce nutrient loads (Lennartz et al., 2014; Jokinen et al., 2018).

There is *medium agreement* (*medium evidence*) that reducing
anthropogenic nutrient inputs may lead to less severe coastal hypoxic
conditions, as observed in the coastal north-western Adriatic Sea
(Djakovac et al., 2015). However, low-oxygen sediments may remain a
long-term source of phosphorus and ammonium to the water column,
fuelling primary production (Jokinen et al., 2018; Fennel and Testa,
2019; Limburg et al., 2020).

Biogeochemical Feedbacks on Climate Change {#biogeochemical-feedbacks-on-climate-change .AR6Chap5Level151}
------------------------------------------

This section covers biogeochemical feedbacks on climate change, which
represent one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate change
projections. The relevant processes are discussed (Sections 5.4.1 to
5.4.4), prior to discussing the simulation and projection of the carbon
cycle in Earth system models (Section 5.4.5), emergent constraints on
future projections (Section 5.4.7), non-CO~2~ feedbacks (Section 5.4.7),
and possible biogeochemical abrupt changes (Section 5.4.8).

### Direct CO~2~ Effect on Land Carbon Uptake  {#direct-co2-effect-on-land-carbon-uptake .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 WGI, Box 6.3) and Special Report
on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL, IPCC, 2019a) concluded with *high
confidence* that rising atmospheric CO~2~ increases leaf-level
photosynthesis. This effect is represented in all Earth system models
(ESMs). New studies since AR5 add evidence that the leaf-level CO~2~
fertilization is modulated by acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term
CO~2~ exposure, growth temperature, seasonal drought, and nutrient
availability, but these effects are not yet routinely represented in
ESMs (Smith and Dukes, 2013; Baig et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2016;
Drake et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020a). Cross-Chapter Box 5.1 assesses
multiple lines of evidence, which suggest that the ratio of plant CO~2~
uptake to water loss – plant water-use efficiency (WUE) – increases in
near proportionality to atmospheric CO~2~. Despite advances in the
regional coverage of field experiments, observations of the consequences
of CO~2~ fertilization at ecosystem level are still scarce, in
particular from outside the temperate zone (Song et al., 2019a). New
syntheses since AR5 corroborate that the effect of elevated CO~2~ on
plant growth and ecosystem carbon storage is generally positive (*high
confidence*), but is modulated by temperature, water and nutrient
availability (Reich et al., 2014; Obermeier et al., 2017; Peñuelas et
al., 2017; Hovenden et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019a). Plant carbon
allocation, changes in plant community composition, disturbance, and
natural plant mortality are important processes affecting the magnitude
of the response, but are currently poorly represented in models (De
Kauwe et al., 2014; Friend et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2018; A.P. Walker
et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019), and thus contribute strongly to
uncertainty in ESM projections (Arora et al., 2020).

Field studies with elevated CO~2~ have demonstrated that the initial
stimulation of above-ground growth may decline if insufficient nutrients
such as nitrogen or phosphorus are available (Finzi et al., 2007; Norby
et al., 2010; Hungate et al., 2013; Reich and Hobbie, 2013; Talhelm et
al., 2014; Terrer et al., 2018). Model-data syntheses have demonstrated
that the ability to capture the observed long-term effect of elevated
CO~2~ depends on models being able to predict the effect of vegetation
on soil biogeochemistry (Zaehle et al., 2014; Koven et al., 2015b;
Medlyn et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015). Meta-analyses of CO~2~
manipulation experiments point to increased soil microbial activity and
accelerated turnover of soil organic matter (van Groenigen et al., 2017)
as a result of increased below-ground carbon allocation by plants (Song
et al., 2019b), and increased root exudation or mycorrhizal activity due
to enhanced plant nutrient requirements under elevated CO~2~ (Drake et
al., 2011; Terrer et al., 2016; Meier et al., 2017). These effects are
not considered in most ESMs. One global model that attempts to represent
these processes suggests that elevated CO~2~-related carbon accumulation
is reduced in soils but increased in vegetation relative to more
conventional models (Sulman et al., 2019).

Our understanding of the effects of phosphorus limitation is less
developed than for nitrogen, but a growing body of literature suggests
that it is just as important, particularly in regions with highly
weathered soils (Wang et al., 2018; Terrer et al., 2019; Du et al.,
2020). CO~2~ experiments collectively show that soil phosphorus is an
important constraint on the CO~2~ fertilization effect on plant biomass
(Terrer et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020a). For example, despite
increases in photosynthesis after four years of CO~2~ exposure, a
free-air CO~2~ enrichment experiment in a phosphorus-limited mature
forest ecosystem did not find an increase in biomass production (Jiang
et al., 2020b). The lack of free-air CO~2~ enrichment experiments in
phosphorus-limited tropical forests limits our understanding of the role
of phosphorus availability in constraining the CO~2~ fertilization
effect globally (Norby et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019). Models
accounting for the effects of phosphorus availability, in addition to
nitrogen, generally show an even stronger reduction of the response of
ecosystem carbon storage to elevated CO~2~ (Goll et al., 2012; Zhang et
al., 2014; X. Yang et al., 2019). Insufficient data and uncertainties in
the process formulation cause large uncertainty in the magnitude of this
effect (Medlyn et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019).

Consistent with AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2), the CO~2~ fertilization effect
is the dominant cause for the projected increase in land carbon uptake
between 1860 and 2100 in ESMs (Figures 5.26 and 5.27, and Table 5.5;
Arora et al., 2020). In the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
6 (CMIP6) ensemble, the increase of land carbon storage due to CO~2~
fertilization is a global phenomenon but is strongest in the tropics
(Figure 5.26). The resulting increase of productivity is a key driver of
increases in vegetation and soil carbon storage. However, consistent
with earlier findings (Todd-Brown et al., 2013; Friend et al., 2014;
Hajima et al., 2014), processes affecting vegetation carbon-use
efficiency and turnover, such as allocation changes, mortality, and
vegetation structural changes, as well as the pre-industrial soil carbon
turnover time, also play an important role (Arora et al., 2020).

As a major advance since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2), six out of 11 models
in the C^4^MIP-CMIP6 ensemble account for nitrogen cycle dynamics over
land (Table 5.4). On average, these models exhibit a 25–30% lower CO~2~
fertilization effect on land carbon storage, compared to models that do
not (Figure 5.29 and Table 5.5). The only model in the C^4^MIP-CMIP6
ensemble that explicitly represents the effect of P availability on
plant growth suggests the lowest C storage response to increasing CO~2~
(Arora et al., 2020). The lower CO~2~ effect due to decreased nutrient
availability is generally consistent with analyses of the implicit
nutrient limitation in CMIP5 simulations (Wieder et al., 2015; Zaehle et
al., 2015) and independent assessments by stand-alone land models
(Zaehle et al., 2010; Wårlind et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Goll et
al., 2017; Meyerholt et al., 2020). The simulated effects are generally
consistent with expectations based on independent observations (Walker
et al., 2020). However, the magnitude of nutrient feedbacks in these
models is poorly constrained by observations, owing to the limited
geographic distribution of available observations and the uncertain
scaling of results obtained from manipulation experiments to transient
system dynamics (Song et al., 2019a; Wieder et al., 2019; Meyerholt et
al., 2020).

Our understanding of the various biological processes that influence the
strength of the CO~2~ fertilization effect on photosynthesis and its
impact on carbon storage in vegetation and soils, (in particular
regarding the limitations imposed by nitrogen and phosphorus
availability), has developed since AR5 (WGI, Box 6.2). Based on
consistent behaviour across all CMIP6 ESMs, there is *high confidence*
that CO~2~ fertilization of photosynthesis acts as an important negative
feedback on anthropogenic climate change, by reducing the rate at which
CO~2~ accumulates in the atmosphere. Since AR5 (WGI, Box 6.2), an
increasing number of CMIP6 ESMs account for nutrient cycles. The
consistent results found in their model projections suggests with *high
confidence* that limited nutrient availability will limit the CO~2~
fertilization effect (Arora et al., 2020). The magnitude of the direct
CO~2~ effect on land carbon uptake, and its limitation by nutrients,
remains uncertain (*low confidence*).

### Direct CO~2~ Effects on Projected Ocean Carbon Uptake {#direct-co2-effects-on-projected-ocean-carbon-uptake .AR6Chap5Level2511}

In AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2) there was *high agreement* that CMIP5 ESMs
project continued ocean CO~2~ uptake through to 2100, with higher uptake
corresponding to higher concentration or emission pathways. There has
been no significant change in the magnitude of the sensitivity of ocean
carbon uptake to increasing atmospheric CO~2~, or in the inter-model
spread, between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 era (Arora et al., 2020). The
analysis from emissions and concentration-driven CMIP5 model projections
show that the ocean sink stops growing beyond 2050 across all emission
scenarios (Section 5.4.5.3). CMIP6 models also show a similar time
evolution of global ocean CO~2~ uptake to CMIP5 models over the 21st
century (Figure 5.25) with decreasing net ocean CO~2~ uptake ratio to
anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions under SSP5-8.5.

The projected weakening of ocean carbon uptake is driven by a
combination of decreasing carbonate buffering capacity and warming,
which are positive feedbacks under weak to no mitigation scenarios (SSP4
and 5). In high mitigation scenarios (SSP1-2.6), weakening ocean carbon
uptake is driven by decreasing emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). The
detailed understanding of carbonate chemistry in seawater that has
accumulated over more than half a century (e.g., Revelle and Suess,
1957; Egleston et al., 2010), provides *high confidence* that the excess
CO~2~ dissolved in seawater leads to a non-linear reduction of the CO~2~
buffering capacity, that is smaller dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
increase with respect to pCO~2~ increase along with the increase in
cumulative ocean CO~2~ uptake. Recent studies (Katavouta et al., 2018;
Jiang et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020) suggest
with *medium confidence* that the decrease in the ocean CO~2~ uptake
ratio to anthropogenic CO~2~ emission, under low to no mitigation
scenarios over the 21st century, is predominantly attributable to the
ocean carbon-concentration feedback through the reduction of the
seawater CO~2~ buffering capacity, but with contributions from physical
drivers such as warming and wind stress (*medium confidence*) and
biological drivers (*low confidence*) (Sections 5.2.1.3.3 and 5.4.4).

Projected increases in ocean DIC due to anthropogenic CO~2~ uptake
amplify the sensitivity of carbonate system variables to perturbations
of DIC in the surface ocean, for example via the amplitude of the
seasonal cycle of pCO~2~, which impacts the mean annual air-sea fluxes
(Hauck et al., 2015; Fassbender et al., 2018; Landschützer et al., 2018;
SROCC, Section 5.2.2.3). A larger amplification of the surface ocean
*p*CO~2~ seasonality occurs in the subtropics where *p*CO~2~ seasonality
is dominated by temperature seasonality, with the summer increase in the
difference in *p*CO~2~ between surface water and the overlying
atmosphere reaching 3μatm per decade between 1990 and 2030 under RCP8.5
(Schlunegger et al., 2019; Rodgers et al., 2020). In contrast, the
impact of biological production on the seasonal cycle of pCO~2~ in
summer in the Southern Ocean strengthens the drawdown of CO~2~ (Hauck et
al., 2015).

Overall, there is *medium confidence* on three outcomes in the ocean
from projected CO~2~ uptake under medium to high CO~2~ concentration
scenarios: (i) a strengthening positive feedback, which impacts on the
airborne fraction via the reduction of the ocean CO~2~ buffering
capacity due to cumulative ocean CO~2~ uptake, which reduces the net
ocean CO~2~ uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO~2~ emission (Katavouta et
al., 2018; Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020); (ii) an
amplification of the seasonal cycle of CO~2~ variables, which impacts
both the ocean sink and ocean acidification (Hauck et al., 2015); (iii)
a decrease in the aragonite and calcite saturation levels in the ocean,
which negatively impacts the calcification rates of marine organisms
(*high confidence*) and forms a negative feedback on the uptake of CO~2~
(McNeil and Sasse, 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3).

### Climate Effect on Land Carbon Uptake {#climate-effect-on-land-carbon-uptake .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The AR5 assessed with *medium confidence*, that future climate change
will decrease land carbon uptake relative to the case with constant
climate, but with a poorly constrained magnitude (AR5 WGI, Chapter 6,
Executive Summary). Ongoing uncertainty in the magnitude and geographic
pattern of the feedbacks (Section 5.4.5), continues to support a *medium
confidence* assessment that future climate change will decrease land
carbon uptake relative to the case with constant climate.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535694 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564281 .anchor}Plant Physiology

Plant productivity is highly dependent on local climate. In cold
environments, warming has generally led to an earlier onset of the
growing season, and with it an increase in early season vegetation
productivity (e.g., Forkel et al., 2016). However, this trend is
influenced by the adverse effects of climate variability, and other
emerging limitations on vegetation production by water, energy and
nutrients, which may gradually reduce the effects of warming (Piao et
al., 2017; Buermann et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). At centennial time
scales, boreal forest expansion may act as a climate-driven carbon sink
(Pugh et al., 2018).

In tropical and temperate environments, temperature simultaneously
affects the metabolic rates of photosynthetic processes within leaf
tissues, as well as the vapour pressure deficit that drives
transpiration, its control by leaf stomata, and the resulting soil and
plant tissue water content. Thus the direct effect of warming on
photosynthesis can be positive, negative, or invariant depending on the
environmental context (Lin et al., 2012; Yamori et al., 2014; Smith and
Dukes, 2017; Grossiord et al., 2020). Observations and models suggest
that the vapour pressure deficit effects are stronger than direct
temperature effects on enzyme activities (Smith et al., 2020), and that
acclimation of photosynthetic optimal temperature may mitigate
productivity losses of tropical forests under climate change (Kattge and
Knorr, 2007; Tan et al., 2017; Kumarathunge et al., 2019). Some models
have begun to include these acclimation responses in photosynthesis and
autotrophic respiration (Lombardozzi et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015;
Huntingford et al., 2017; Mercado et al., 2018).

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535695 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564282 .anchor}Fire and Other
    Disturbances

The SRCCL assessed that climate change is playing an increasing role in
determining wildfire regimes alongside human activity (*medium
confidence*), with future climate variability expected to enhance the
recurrence and severity of wildfires in many biomes, such as tropical
rainforests (*high confidence*). Projections of increased fire weather
in a warmer climate are widespread (Section 12.3.2.8) and may drive
increased fire frequency and severity in several regions, including
Arctic and boreal ecosystems (Gauthier et al., 2015; X.J. Walker et al.,
2019), Mediterranean-type ecosystems (Turco et al., 2014; Jin et al.,
2015), degraded tropical forests (Aragão et al., 2018), and tropical
forest-savanna transition zones (Lehmann et al., 2014).

Wildfire is included in some CMIP6 ESMs (Table 5.4) and is thus only
partially represented in estimates of carbon–climate feedbacks from
these models. The CMIP5 ESMs that include fire project an 8–58% increase
of fire carbon emissions under future scenarios, with higher emissions
under higher warming scenarios; the ensemble spread is driven by
differing factors such as population density, fire management, and other
land-use processes (Kloster and Lasslop, 2017). Fire dynamics in CMIP6
models, as evaluated in land-only configurations of CMIP6-generation
land surface models, also show large variations but better agreement
with observations (Teckentrup et al., 2019; Hantson et al., 2020;
Lasslop et al., 2020).

Climate change also drives changes to vegetation composition and
ecosystem carbon storage through other disturbances such as forest
dieback that lead to biome shifts in tropical forests (Cox et al., 2004;
Jones et al., 2009; Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et
al., 2017), and temperate and boreal regions (Joos et al., 2001; Lucht
et al., 2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016). The AR5
assessed that large-scale loss of tropical forests due to climate change
is *unlikely* (WGI, Section 6.4.9). Newer ecosystem modelling approaches
that include a greater degree of ecosystem heterogeneity and diversity
show a reduced sensitivity of such forest dieback-type changes (Levine
et al., 2016; Sakschewski et al., 2016), supporting the AR5 assessment
(Section 5.4.8). Beyond such biome shifts, observations of tropical
forests also show that increasing tree mortality rates within tropical
forests may reduce carbon turnover times and storage (Brienen et al.,
2015), that increased tree mortality rates in tropical forests and
elsewhere are expected with increased temperatures and vapour pressure
deficit (Cross-Chapter Box 5.1; Allen et al., 2015; McDowell et al.,
2018; Grossiord et al., 2020), and that these processes are not well
represented in ESMs (Powell et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2018). An
ensemble of land models that includes ecological processes such as
forest demography shows that changes to mortality may be a more
important driver of carbon dynamics than changes to productivity (Friend
et al., 2014).

Overall, climate change will force widespread increases in fire weather
throughout the world (Section 12.3.2.8). Because of incomplete inclusion
of fire in ESMs, a separate compilation of fire-driven carbon–climate
feedback estimates (Section 5.4.8; Eliseev et al., 2014a; Harrison et
al., 2018). There is *low agreement* in magnitude and *medium*
*agreement* in sign which, alongside other literature (Jones et al.,
2020), leads to an assessment of *medium confidence* that fire
represents a positive carbon–climate feedback, but *very low confidence*
in the magnitude of that feedback. Other disturbances such as tree
mortality will increase across several ecosystems (*medium agreement*)
with decreased vegetation carbon (*medium confidence*). However, the
lack of model agreement and key process representation in ESMs leads to
a *low confidence* assessment in the projected magnitude of this
feedback.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535696 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564283 .anchor}Soil Carbon

Changes to soil carbon stocks in response to climate change are a
potentially strong positive feedback (Cox et al., 2000). Since AR5 (WGI,
Section 6.4.2), progress has been made in understanding soil carbon
dynamics, and associated feedbacks. These include: (i) an increased
understanding of and ability to quantify high-latitude soil carbon
feedbacks (Box 5.1); (ii) increased understanding of the causes
responsible for soil carbon persistence on long time scales,
particularly the interactions between decomposers and soil organic
matter and mineral assemblages (Kleber et al., 2007; Schmidt et al.,
2011; Luo et al., 2016); and (iii) increased understanding of soil
carbon dynamics in subsurface layers (Hicks Pries et al., 2017;
Balesdent et al., 2018).

CMIP6 ESMs predict losses of soil carbon with warming, which are larger
than climate-driven vegetation carbon losses (Arora et al., 2020). As in
CMIP5 (Todd-Brown et al., 2013), there is also a large CMIP6 ensemble
spread in climate-driven soil carbon changes, partially driven by a
large spread in the current soil carbon stocks predicted by the models.
In CMIP5 ESMs, much of the soil carbon losses with warming can be traced
to decreased carbon inputs, with a weaker contribution from changing
soil carbon lifetimes due to faster decomposition rates (Koven et al.,
2015b), which may be an artefact of the lack of permafrost carbon (Box
5.1). Isotopic constraints suggest that CMIP5 ESMs systematically
overestimated the transient sensitivity of soil ^14^C responses to
atmospheric ^14^C changes, implying that the models respond too quickly
to changes in either inputs or turnover times, and that therefore the
soil contribution to all feedbacks may be weaker than currently
projected (He et al., 2016). Using natural gradients of soil carbon
turnover as a constraint on long-term responses to warming suggests that
both CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs may systematically underestimate the
temperature sensitivity at high latitudes, and may overestimate the
temperature sensitivity in the tropics (Koven et al., 2017; Wieder et
al., 2018; Varney et al., 2020), although experimental soil warming in
tropical forests suggest high sensitivity of decomposition to warming in
those regions as well (Nottingham et al., 2020).

Peat soils, where thick organic layers build up due to saturated and
anoxic conditions, represent another possible source of carbon to the
atmosphere. Peats could dry, and decompose or burn as a result of
climate change in both high (Chaudhary et al., 2020) and tropical (Cobb
et al., 2017) latitudes, and in combination with anthropogenic drainage
of peatlands (Warren et al., 2017). Peat carbon dynamics are not
included in the majority of CMIP6 ESMs.\
\
Soil microbial dynamics shift in response to temperature, giving rise to
complex longer-term trophic effects that are more complex than the
short-term sensitivity of decomposition to temperature. Such responses
are observed in response to long-term warming experiments (Melillo et
al., 2017). While most CMIP6 ESMs do not include microbial dynamics,
simplified global soil models that do include such dynamics show greater
uncertainty in projections of soil C changes, despite agreeing more
closely with current observations, than the linear models used in most
ESMs (Wieder et al., 2013; Guenet et al., 2018).

In nutrient-limited ecosystems, prolonged soil warming can induce a
fertilization effect through increased decomposition, which increases
nutrient availability and thereby vegetation productivity (Melillo et
al., 2011). Models that include this process tend to show a weaker
carbon–climate feedback than those that do not (Thornton et al., 2009;
Zaehle et al., 2010; Wårlind et al., 2014; Meyerholt et al., 2020). In
CMIP6, six out of 11 ESMs include a representation of the nitrogen
cycle, and the mean of those models predicts a weaker carbon–climate
feedback than the overall ensemble mean (Arora et al., 2020; Section
5.4.8). These models only partly account for the interactions of
nutrient effects with other processes, such as shifts of vegetation
zones under climate changes (Sakaguchi et al., 2016) leading to either
changes in species composition or changes in plant tissue nutrient to
carbon ratios (Thomas et al., 2015; Achat et al., 2016; Du et al.,
2019).

The *high agreement* and multiple lines of evidence that warming
increases decomposition rates lead to *high confidence* that warming
will, overall, result in carbon losses relative to a constant climate
and contribute to the positive carbon–climate feedback (Section 5.4.8).
However, widespread ESM projections and the lack of model representation
of key processes that may amplify or mitigate soil carbon losses on
longer time scales (including microbial dynamics, permafrost, peatlands,
and nutrients) lead to *low confidence* in the magnitude of global soil
carbon losses with warming.

Permafrost Carbon and Feedbacks to Climate {#permafrost-carbon-and-feedbacks-to-climate .AR6Chap5Box}
------------------------------------------

**What is permafrost carbon and why should we be concerned about it?**

Soils in the Arctic and other cold regions contain perennially frozen
layers, known as permafrost. Soils in the northern permafrost region
store a large amount of organic carbon, estimated at 1460–1600 PgC
across surface soils and deeper deposits (Hugelius et al., 2014; Strauss
et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2021). Of that carbon, permafrost soils and
deposits store 1070–1360 PgC, of which 300–400 PgC are in the first
metre, and the rest at depth. The remaining 280–340 PgC are in
permafrost-free soils within the permafrost region. These carbon
deposits have accumulated over thousands of years due to the slow rates
of organic matter decomposition in frozen and/or waterlogged soil
layers, but these frozen soils are highly decomposable upon thaw
(Schädel et al., 2014).

**Is permafrost carbon already thawing and emitting greenhouse gases? **

The permafrost region was a historic carbon sink over centuries to
millennia (*high confidence*) (Loisel et al., 2014; Lindgren et al.,
2018). Currently though, thawing soils due to anthropogenic warming are
losing carbon from the decomposition of old frozen organic matter, as
found via carbon 14 (^14^C) signature of respiration at sites undergoing
rapid permafrost thaw (Hicks Pries et al., 2013), of dissolved organic
carbon in rivers draining watersheds with permafrost thaw (Vonk et al.,
2015; Wild et al., 2019), and of methane (CH~4)~ produced in thawing
lakes (Walter Anthony et al., 2016).

Despite accumulating evidence of increased carbon losses, it is
difficult to scale up site- and ecosystem-level measurements to assess
the net carbon balance over the entire permafrost region, due to the
high spatial heterogeneity, the strong seasonal cycles, and the
difficulty in monitoring these regions consistently across the year. The
Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climte (SROCC)
assessed with *high confidence* that ecosystems in the permafrost region
act as carbon sinks during the summer growing season, and that
wintertime carbon losses are significant, consistent with a
multi-decadal small increase in CO~2~ emissions during early winter at
Barrow, Alaska (Sweeney et al., 2016; Webb et al., 2016; Meredith et
al., 2019). These findings have been further strengthened by recent
comprehensive synthesis of in-situ wintertime flux observations that
show large carbon losses during the non-growing season (Natali et al.,
2019). Increased autumn and winter respiration are a key large-scale
fingerprint of top-down permafrost thaw predicted by ecosystem models
(Parazoo et al., 2018). However, the length of these wintertime
observational records is too short to unequivocally determine whether
winter carbon losses are higher now than they used to be. One study
inferred a multi-year net CO~2~ source for the tundra in Alaska (Commane
et al., 2017), which is equivalent to 0.3 PgC yr^–1^ when scaled up to
the northern permafrost region (*low confidence*) (Meredith et al.,
2019).

Since AR5, evidence of a more active carbon cycle in the northern
high-latitude regions has also been observed through the increased
amplitude of CO~2~ seasonal cycles. However, the relative roles of local
sources versus influence from mid-latitudes makes it difficult to infer
changes to Arctic ecosystems from these observations (Graven et al.,
2013; Forkel et al., 2016; Takata et al., 2017; Bruhwiler et al., 2021).
Estimates of CO~2~ fluxes with atmospheric inversion models showed an
enhanced seasonal cycle amplitude but no significant trends in annual
total fluxes, in agreement with flux tower measurements over one decade
(2004–2013) (Welp et al., 2016; Takata et al., 2017).

In addition to CO~2~, CH~4~ emissions from the northern permafrost
region contribute to the global methane budget, but evidence as to
whether these emissions have increased from thawing permafrost is mixed.
The SROCC assigned *low confidence* to the degree of recent additional
methane emissions from diverse sources throughout the permafrost region.
These include observed regional lake area change, which suggest a 1.6–5
Tg CH~4~ yr^–1^ increase over the last 50 years (Walter Anthony et al.,
2016), ice-capped geological sources (Walter Anthony et al., 2012;
Kohnert et al., 2017), and shallow Arctic Ocean shelves. The shallow
subsea emissions are particularly uncertain due to the wide range of
estimates (3 Tg CH~4~ yr^–1^ (Thornton et al., 2016b) to 17 Tg CH~4~
yr^–1^ (Shakhova et al., 2014)), and the lack of a baseline with which
to infer any changes; however, the upper half of this range in flux
estimates is inconsistent with the atmospheric inversions constrained by
the pan-Arctic CH~4~ concentration measurements (Berchet et al., 2016).

Atmospheric measurements and inversions performed at the global and
regional scales do not show any detectable trends in annual mean CH~4~
emissions from the permafrost region over the past 30 years (Jackson et
al., 2020; Saunois et al., 2020; Bruhwiler et al., 2021), consistent
with atmospheric measurements in Alaska that showed no significant
annual trends, despite significant increase in air temperature (Sweeney
et al., 2016). Atmospheric inversions and biospheric models do not show
any clear trends in CH~4~ emission for wetland regions of the high
latitudes during the period 2000–2016 (Patra et al., 2016; Poulter et
al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2020; Saunois et al., 2020). Large
uncertainties on wetland extent and limited data constraints place *low
confidence* in these modelling approaches.

The SROCC also assessed with *high confidence* that methane fluxes have
been under-observed due to their high variability at multiple scales in
both space and time, and that there is a persistent mismatch between
top-down and bottom-up methane budgets, with emissions calculated by
upscaling ground observations typically higher than emissions inferred
from large-scale atmospheric observations (Thornton et al., 2016a).

In conclusion, there is *high confidence* that the permafrost region has
acted as a historic carbon sink over centuries to millennia, and *high
confidence* that some permafrost regions are currently net sources of
CO~2~. There is *robust evidence* that some CH~4~ emission sources for
some regions have increased over the past decades (*medium confidence*).
For the northern permafrost-wide region, no multi-decadal trend has been
detected on CO~2~ and CH~4~ fluxes but, given the low resolution and
sparse observations of current observations and modelling sytems, we
place *low confidence* in this statement.

Since AR5, there have been new studies showing that permafrost thaw also
leads to nitrous oxide (N~2~O) release from soil (Abbott and Jones,
2015; Karelin et al., 2017; Wilkerson et al., 2019), a previously
unaccounted source. However, this release is unquantified at the
pan-Arctic scale.

**What does the paleo record tell us about** **expected emissions?**

Large areas of Alaska and Siberia are underlain by frozen, glacial-age,
ice- and carbon-rich deposits, and many of these areas show evidence of
thermokarst processes during Holocene warm periods. Rapid warming of
high northern latitudes contributed to permafrost thaw, liberating
labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al., 2014; Crichton
et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019), supporting
the vulnerability of these areas to further warming (Strauss et al.,
2013, 2017).

Radiogenic and stable isotopic measurements on CH~4~ trapped in
Antarctic ice support the view that CH~4~ emissions from fossil carbon
reservoirs remained small, including permafrost and methane hydrates, in
response to the deglacial warming. Mass-balance calculations reveal that
geological CH~4~ emissions have not exceeded 19 Tg yr^–1^, highlighting
that the deglacial increase in CH~4~ emissions was predominantly related
to contemporary methane emissions from tropical wetlands and seasonally
inundated floodplains (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017;
Dyonisius et al., 2020). Isotopic constraints on CO~2~ losses from
permafrost with warming after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are weaker
than for CH~4~. While the biosphere as a whole held less carbon during
the LGM than the pre-industrial, that change in stocks was smaller than
the change in plant productivity, and so carbon losses at high latitudes
may have been offset by increased tropical productivity in response to
warming during the Last Deglacial Transition (LDT; Ciais et al., 2012).
There is also paleoclimate evidence for processes that mitigate carbon
losses with warming on longer time scales, such as longer-term carbon
accumulation in lake deposits following thermokarst thaw (Walter Anthony
et al., 2014), and long-term accumulation of carbon in permafrost soils
following LDT carbon loss (Lindgren et al., 2018), particularly in
peatlands which accumulated carbon at a slow but persistent rate in warm
paleoclimates (Treat et al., 2019).

In conclusion, several independent lines of evidence indicate that
permafrost thaw did not release vast quantities of fossil CH~4~
associated with the transient warming events of the LDT. This suggests
that large emissions of CH~4~ from old carbon sources will not occur in
response to future warming (*medium confidence*).

**How much emissions** **do we expect in the future? **

Near-surface permafrost is projected to decrease significantly under
future global warming scenarios (*high confidence*) (Section 9.5.2),
thus creating the potential for releasing CO~2~ and CH~4~ to the
atmosphere, and act as a positive carbon–climate feedback.

The processes that govern permafrost carbon loss are grouped into
gradual and abrupt mechanisms. Gradual processes include the deepening
of the seasonally thawed active layer into perennially frozen permafrost
layers and lengthening of the thawed season within the active layer,
which increases the amount of organic carbon that is thawed and the
duration of thaw. Abrupt thaw processes include ice-wedge polygon
degradation, hillslope collapse, thermokarst lake expansion and
draining, all of which are processes largely occurring in regions with
very high soil carbon content (Olefeldt et al., 2016a, b). Abrupt thaw
processes can contribute up to half of the total net greenhouse gas
release from permafrost loss, the rest attributed to gradual thaw
(Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Turetsky et al., 2020). Increased
fire frequency and severity (Hu et al., 2010) also contributes to abrupt
emissions and the removal of the insulating cover which leads to an
acceleration of permafrost thaw (Genet et al., 2013). Ecological
feedbacks can both mitigate and amplify carbon losses: nutrient release
from increased organic matter decomposition can drive vegetation growth
that partially offsets soil carbon losses (Salmon et al., 2016), but
also lead to biophysical feedbacks that further amplify warming
(Myers-Smith et al., 2011).

Through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), Earth
system models (ESMs) had not included permafrost carbon dynamics. This
remains largely true in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
(CMIP6), with most models not representing permafrost carbon processes,
a small number representing the active-layer thickening effect on
decomposition (Table 5.4), and no ESMs representing thermokarst or
fire-permafrost-carbon interactions. The CMIP6 ensemble mean predicts a
negative carbon–climate feedback in the permafrost region. However,
those that do include permafrost carbon show a positive carbon–climate
feedback in the permafrost region (Figure 5.27). Given the current
limited ESM capacity to assess permafrost feedbacks, estimates in this
report are based on published permafrost-enabled land surface model
results.

The SROCC assessed that warming under a high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5
or similar) would result in a loss of permafrost carbon by 2100 of 10s
to 100s of PgC, with a maximum estimate of 240 PgC and a best estimate
of 92 ± 17 PgC (Meredith et al., 2019; SROCC, Figure 3.11). Under lower
emissions scenarios, Schneider von Deimling et al. (2015) estimated
permafrost feedbacks of 20–58 PgC of CO~2~ by 2100 under an RCP2.6
scenario, and 28–92 PgC of CO~2~ under an RCP4.5 scenario.

This new assessment, based on studies included in or published since
SROCC (Schaefer et al., 2014; Koven et al., 2015c; Schneider von
Deimling et al., 2015; Schuur et al., 2015; MacDougall and Knutti,
2016a; Gasser et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020), estimates that the
permafrost CO~2~ feedback per degree of global warming (Figure 5.29) is
18 (3.1–41, 5–95th percentile range) PgC ºC^–1^. The assessment is based
on a wide range of scenarios evaluated at 2100, and an assessed estimate
of the permafrost CH~4~-climate feedback at 2.8 (0.7–7.3 5–95th
percentile range) PgCeq ºC^–1^ (Figure 5.29). This feedback affects the
remaining carbon budgets for climate stabilization and is included in
their assessment (Section 5.5.2).

Beyond 2100, models suggest that the magnitude of the permafrost carbon
feedback strengthens considerably over the period 2100–2300 under a
high-emissions scenario (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; McGuire et
al., 2018). Schneider von Deimling et al. (2015) estimated that thawing
permafrost could release 20–40 PgC of CO~2~ in the period from 2100 to
2300 under an RCP2.6 scenario, and 115–172 PgC of CO~2~ under an RCP8.5
scenario. The multi-model ensemble (McGuire et al., 2018) projects a
much wider range of permafrost soil carbon losses of 81–642 PgC (mean
314 PgC) for an RCP8.5 scenario from 2100 to 2300, and of a gain of 14
PgC to a loss of 54 PgC (mean loss of 17 PgC) for an RCP4.5 scenario
over the same period.

Methane release from permafrost thaw (including abrupt thaw) under a
high-warming RCP8.5 scenario has been estimated at 836–2614 Tg CH~4~
over the 21st century and 2800–7400 Tg CH~4~ from 2100–2300 (Schneider
von Deimling et al., 2015), and as 5300 Tg CH~4~ over the 21st century
and 16,000 Tg CH~4~ from 2100–2300 (Turetsky et al., 2020). For RCP4.5,
these numbers are 538–2356 Tg CH~4~ until 2100 and 2000–6100 Tg CH~4~
from 2100–2300 (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015), and 4100 Tg CH~4~
until 2100 and 10,000 Tg CH~4~ from 2100–2300 (Turetsky et al., 2020).

A key uncertainty is whether permafrost carbon feedbacks scale roughly
linearly with warming (Koven et al., 2015c), or instead scale at a
greater (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016b; McGuire et al., 2018) or smaller
rate (e.g., CH~4~ emissions estimated by Turetsky et al., 2020a). It
also remains unclear whether the permafrost carbon pool represents a
coherent global tipping element of the Earth system with a single abrupt
threshold (Drijfhout et al., 2015) at a given level of global warming,
or a local scale tipping point without abrupt thresholds when aggregated
across the pan-Arctic region, as is suggested by recent model results
(e.g., Koven et al., 2015a; McGuire et al., 2018).

In conclusion, thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon
release under a warmer world (*high confidence*). However, there is *low
confidence* on the timing, magnitude and linearity of the permafrost
climate feedback owing to the wide range of published estimates and the
incomplete knowledge and representation in models of drivers and
relationships. It is projected that CO~2~ released from permafrost will
be 18 (3.1–41) PgC per 1°C by 2100, with the relative contribution of
CO~2~ vs CH~4~ remaining poorly constrained. Permafrost carbon feedbacks
are included among the under-represented feedbacks quantified in Figure
5.29.

### Climate Effects on Future Ocean Carbon Uptake  {#climate-effects-on-future-ocean-carbon-uptake .AR6Chap5Level2511}

1.  []{#_Toc70535699 .anchor}Physical Drivers of Future Ocean Carbon
    Uptake and Storage

The principal contribution to increasing global ocean carbon is the
air-sea flux of CO~2~, which changes the dissolved inorganic carbon
(DIC) inventory (Section 5.4.2; Arora et al., 2020). The processes that
influence the variability and trends of the ocean carbon-heat nexus are
assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 5.3. Climate has three important impacts
on the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO~2~: (i) ocean warming reduces
the solubility of CO~2~, which increases *p*CO~2~ and increases the
stratification of the mixed layer, both acting as positive feedbacks
weakening the ocean sink (Section 9.2.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Arora
et al., 2020); (ii) changing the temporal and spatial characteristics of
wind stress and storm alters mixing – entrainment in, and across the
bottom of, the mixed layer (Bronselaer et al., 2018); and (iii) warming
and wind stress influence the large-scale meridional overturning
circulation (MOC) circulation, which modifies the rate of ventilation,
storage or outgassing of ocean carbon in the ocean interior (Section
5.2.3.1; Gruber et al., 2019b; Arora et al., 2020). The land-to-ocean
riverine flux and the carbon burial in ocean sediments also play a minor
role (*low confidence*) (Arora et al., 2020). Based on *high agreement*
of projections by coupled climate models, there is *high confidence*
that the resultant climate-carbon cycle feedbacks are positive, but the
extent of the ocean sink weakening is scenario dependent (Arora et al.,
2020).

Regionally, the Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO~2~
(Figure 5.8a), although challenges in modelling its circulation and
Antarctic sea ice transport (Sections 3.4.1.2, 9.2.3.2 and 9.3.2)
generate uncertainty in the response of its sink to future
carbon–climate feedbacks. Increased freshwater input may cause a
slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to increased
Southern Ocean biological carbon storage (Ito et al., 2015);
alternatively, increased winds may intensify the overturning
circulation, reducing the net CO~2~ sink in the Southern Ocean
(Bronselaer et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2018). On centennial time
scales, there is thus *low confidence* in the overall effect of
intensifying winds in the Southern Ocean on CO~2~ uptake.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535700 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564286 .anchor}Biological Drivers
    of Future Ocean Carbon Uptake

While physical drivers control the present-day anthropogenic carbon
sink, biological processes are responsible for the majority of the
vertical gradient in DIC (natural carbon storage). A small fraction of
the organic carbon fixed by primary production (PP) reaches the sea
floor, where it can be stored in sediments on geological time scales,
making the biological carbon pump (BCP) an important mechanism for very
long-term CO~2~ storage. Projected reductions in ocean ventilation
(Section 9.2.1.4) would lengthen residence time and lead to DIC
accumulating in the deep ocean due to organic carbon remineralization.

Since AR5 (Section 6.3.2.5.6), progress has been made in understanding
the biological drivers of ocean carbon uptake in both coupled climate
models and observations (SROCC, Section 5.2.2.6). Here we focus on
potential feedbacks between biological processes and climate. In CMIP5
models, the direction of modelled PP in response to increased
atmospheric CO~2~ concentration and climate warming was []{#_Hlk74845561
.anchor}unclear (Taucher and Oschlies, 2011; Laufkötter et al., 2015).
This remains the case in the CMIP6 models; inter-model uncertainty has
increased in CMIP6 models, compared to CMIP5. The projected global
multi-model mean change in PP in 13 models run under the SSP5−8.5
scenario project is −3 ± 9% (2080–2099 mean values relative to 1870–1899
± the inter-model standard deviation; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Under
the low-emission, high-mitigation scenario SSP1−2.6, the global change
in PP is −0.56 ± 4%. Observations in the contemporary period provide
little direct constraint on the modelled responses of PP to climate
change, partly due to insufficiently long records (Henson et al., 2016).
However, there is some indication of an emergent constraint on changes
in tropical PP based on interannual variability derived from remote
sensing (Section 5.4.6; Kwiatkowski et al., 2017).

In CMIP5 models run under RCP8.5, particulate organic carbon (POC)
export flux is projected to decline by 1–12% by 2100 (Taucher and
Oschlies, 2011; Laufkoetter et al., 2015). Similar values are predicted
in 18 CMIP6 models, with declines of 2.5–21.5% (median –14%) or 0.2–2
GtC (median –0.8 GtC) between 1900 and 2100 under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
The mechanisms driving these changes vary widely between models due to
differences in parametrization of particle formation, remineralization
and plankton community structure.

Ocean warming reduces the vertical supply of nutrients to the upper
ocean due to increasing stratification (Section 9.2.1.4) but may also
act to alleviate seasonal light limitation. The projected effect is to
decrease PP at low latitudes and increase PP at high latitudes
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Future changes to dust deposition due to
desertification (Mahowald et al., 2017), alterations to the nitrogen
cycle (Section 5.3.3.2; SROCC, Section 5.2.3.1.2), and reducing sea ice
cover (Ardyna and Arrigo, 2020) all have the potential to alter PP
regionally. Higher ocean temperatures tend to result in higher metabolic
rates, although respiration may increase more rapidly than PP
(Boscolo-Galazzo et al., 2018; Brewer, 2019; Cavan et al., 2019). Ocean
warming and reduced PP are expected to result in lower zooplankton
abundance, and the expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) may reduce
the ability of zooplankton to remineralize POC, thus increasing the
efficiency of the BCP and forming a negative climate feedback (Cavan et
al., 2017). Increased microbial respiration due to warming may result in
greater quantities of organic carbon transferred into the dissolved
organic carbon pool (Jiao et al., 2014; Legendre et al., 2015; Roshan
and DeVries, 2017) which, while increasing the residence time of carbon
in the ocean, would ultimately reduce the sedimentary burial, and hence
sequestration on geologic time scales (Olivarez Lyle and Lyle, 2006).

Most models project that smaller phytoplankton are favoured in future
ocean conditions (*medium confidence*; Cabré et al., 2015; Fu et al.,
2016; Flombaum et al., 2020) driven by warming water and/or changing
nutrient availability, which would alter the magnitude and efficiency of
the BCP by altering the sinking speed, respiration rate and
aggregation/fragmentation of sinking particles. There is *low
confidence* in the sign of the resulting feedback: regions in which
small phytoplankton dominate may have a more efficient pump, although
the total amount of organic carbon reaching the sea floor is lower
(Herndl and Reinthaler, 2013; Bach et al., 2016; Richardson, 2019).
Alternatively, an increase in small phytoplankton could result in a less
efficient pump, due either to a greater fraction of PP being processed
through the upper ocean microbial loop (Jiao et al., 2014) or generation
of slower sinking particles (Guidi et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2021).
Variable phytoplankton stoichiometry is predicted to increase the amount
of carbon stored via the BCP relative to the amount of PP, so that fixed
stoichiometry models (as in CMIP5) may underestimate cumulative ocean
carbon uptake to 2100 by 0.5–3.5% (2–15 PgC; RCP8.5 scenario;
Kwiatkowski et al., 2018). Other climate effects such as deoxygenation
or ocean acidification could also result in alterations to the magnitude
and efficiency of the BCP (Krumhardt et al., 2019; Raven et al., 2021;
Taucher et al., 2021).

Based on *high agreement* across multiple lines of evidence and physical
understanding there is *high confidence* that feedbacks to climate will
arise from alterations to the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP
changing PP, and the depth of remineralization. However, the complexity
of the mechanisms involved in the export and remineralization of POC
result in *low confidence* in the magnitude and sign of biological
feedbacks to climate. Nevertheless, improved model representation of PP
and the BCP is required (which requires better observational
constraints), as the contribution of biological processes to CO~2~
uptake is expected to become more significant with continued climate
change (Hauck et al., 2015).

### Carbon Cycle Projections in Earth System Models {#carbon-cycle-projections-in-earth-system-models .AR6Chap5Level2511}

This section summarizes future projections of land and ocean carbon
sinks from the latest Earth system models (ESMs). ESMs are the basis for
century time-scale projections (Chapter 4), and for detection and
attribution studies (Chapter 3). These models aim to simulate the
evolution of the carbon sources and sinks on land and in the ocean, in
addition to the physical components of the climate system. ESMs include
interactions between many of the processes and feedbacks described in
Sections 5.4.1 to 5.4.4.

ESMs are now integral to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP). Model output data from CMIP5 was analysed in AR5, while data
from CMIP6 forms the basis for the analysis presented in this
subsection. The CMIP5 ESMs discussed in AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2)
produced a wide range of projections of future CO~2~ (Friedlingstein et
al., 2014b) primarily associated with different magnitudes of
carbon–climate and carbon-concentration feedbacks (Arora et al., 2013),
but also exacerbated by differences in the simulation of the net carbon
release from land-use change (Brovkin et al., 2013). A key deficiency of
almost all CMIP5 ESMs was the neglect of nutrient limitations on
CO~2~-fertilization of land plant photosynthesis (Section 5.4.1; Zaehle
et al., 2015).

Some CMIP6 models considered in this report now include nitrogen
limitations on land vegetation growth, along with many other added
processes compared to CMIP5. Table 5.4 summarizes characteristics of the
land and ocean carbon cycle models used in CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et al.,
2020). In CMIP6, most ocean carbon cycle models (8 of 11) track three or
more limiting nutrients (most often nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon,
iron), and represent two or more phytoplankton types. More than half of
the land carbon cycle models (6 of 11) now include an interactive
nitrogen cycle, and almost half (5 of 11) represent forest fires.
However, even for CMIP6, very few models explicitly represent vegetation
dynamics (3 of 11) or permafrost carbon (2 of 11). Despite these
remaining limitations, the carbon cycle components of CMIP6 represent an
advance on those in CMIP5, as they represent additional important
processes (e.g. nitrogen limitations on the land carbon sink, and iron
limitations on ocean ecosystems).

ESMs can be driven by anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions (‘emissions-driven’
runs), in which case atmospheric CO~2~ concentration is a predicted
variable; or by prescribed time-varying atmospheric concentrations
(‘concentration-driven’ runs). In concentration-driven runs, simulated
land and ocean carbon sinks respond to the prescribed atmospheric CO~2~
and resulting changes in climate, but do not feed back through changes
in the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration. Concentration-driven runs are
used to diagnose the carbon emissions consistent with the Shared
Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and other prescribed concentration
scenarios (Section 5.5). In this subsection we specifically analyse
results from concentration-driven ESM projections.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535702 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564288 .anchor}Evaluation of the
    Contemporary Carbon Cycle in Concentration-driven Runs

To give confidence in their projections, models need to be compared to
the widest possible array of observational benchmarks. This is
particularly the case for highly uncertain land carbon cycle feedbacks
(Arora et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014b). Land models within
ESMs can be compared to multiple different datasets of processes such as
gross carbon uptake, physical predictions such as leaf area and carbon
stocks, which influence carbon fluxes and are diagnostic of carbon
turnover times, as well as linkages between carbon and water cycles and
other aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle. To provide these multiple
orthogonal constraints, a model benchmarking system – the international
land model benchmarking (ILAMB) – has been developed (Collier et al.,
2018).

Figure 5.22 shows an overview set of land (Figure 5.22a) and ocean
(Figure 5.22b) benchmarks applied to both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical
simulations. There is good evidence of an improvement in model
performance from CMIP5 (in yellow) to CMIP6 (in green), in both the land
and ocean, based on these benchmarks. The mean of the CMIP6 land models
outperforms or performs equivalently to the mean of the CMIP5 land
models on all available metrics.

    Historical Carbon Cycle Simulations in Concentration-driven Runs

This section evaluates concentration-driven historical simulations of
changes in land and ocean cumulative carbon uptake, against
observation-based estimates from the Global Carbon Project (GCP; Le
Quéré et al., 2018a). For each model, common historical land-use changes
were prescribed (Jones et al., 2016a).

Figure 5.23 shows global annual mean values from CMIP6
concentration-driven runs for 1850 to 2014. The ocean carbon cycle
models reproduce historical carbon uptake well, with the model range for
the global ocean carbon sink in 2014 (2.3–2.7 GtC yr^–1^) clustering
around the central GCP estimate of 2.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr^–1^. Simulated
cumulative ocean carbon uptake (1850–2014) ranges from 110 to 166 GtC,
with a model mean of 131 ± 17 PgC, which is lower than the GCP estimate
of 150 ± 25 GtC (Figure 5.23a). This suggests that CMIP6 models may
slightly underestimate historical ocean carbon uptake (Watson et al.,
2020).

The land carbon cycle components of historical ESM simulations show a
larger range, with simulated cumulative land carbon uptake (1850–2014)
spanning the range from –47 to +21 GtC, compared to the GCP estimate of
–12 ± 50 GtC (Figure 5.23b). This range is due in part to the
complications of simulating the difference between carbon uptake by
intact ecosystems and the direct release of carbon due to land-use
change (Hajima et al., 2020a). There is *high confidence* that the land
continues to dominate the overall uncertainty in the projected response
of the global carbon cycle to climate change.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535704 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564290 .anchor}Evaluation of
    Latitudinal Distribution of Simulated Carbon Sinks

This distinction between the relatively high fidelity with which the
ocean carbon sink is simulated, and the much wider range of simulations
of the land carbon sink, is also evident in the zonal distribution of
the sinks (Figure 5.24). We compare the ESM simulations to estimates
from three atmospheric inversion models: CAMS (Chevallier et al., 2005),
CT 2017 (Peters et al., 2007) and MIROC-ATM4 (Saeki and Patra, 2017).
The ocean carbon cycle components of CMIP6 ESMs are able to simulate the
tropical CO~2~ source and mid-latitude CO~2~ sink, with relatively small
model spread (Figure 5.24a). The CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge) simulates a
larger ocean carbon sink at 50^o^N and a weaker sink in the Southern
Ocean, than the inversion estimate, but with some evidence of a
reduction in these residual errors compared to CMIP5 (blue wedge). The
spread in inversion fluxes arises primarily from differences in the
atmospheric CO~2~ measurement networks and from transport model
uncertainties.

It has been previously noted that AR5 models tended to overestimate land
uptake in the tropics and underestimate uptake in the northern
mid-latitudes, compared to inversion estimates. The inclusion of
nitrogen limitations on CO~2~-fertilization within CMIP6 models was
expected to reduce this discrepancy (Anav et al., 2013). There is some
evidence that the CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge in Figure 5.24b) captures
the northern land carbon sink more clearly than CMIP5 (blue wedge in
Figure 5.24b), but there remains a tendency for the ESMs to place more
of the global land carbon sink in the tropics than the mid-latitudes,
compared to the inversion estimates. Based on a consistent signal across
CMIP6 ESMs, there is *medium confidence* that land carbon cycle models
continue to underestimate the northern hemisphere land carbon sink, when
compared to estimates from atmospheric inversion (Ciais et al., 2019).

    (i.e., –90^o^N) to 90^o^N. Positive uptake represents a carbon sink
    to ocean/land while negative uptake represents a carbon source. The
    land uptake is taken as Net Biome Productivity (NBP) and so includes
    net land-use change emissions. The bands show the mean ±1 standard
    deviation across the available inversions (black bands, 3 models),
    CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) (blue bands, 12 models for the
    ocean, 12 models for the land), and CMIP6 ESMs (red bands, 11 models
    for ocean, 10 models for land). Further details on data sources and
    processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.24 HERE\] **

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535705 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564291 .anchor}Coupled
    Climate–Carbon Cycle Projections

Land and ocean carbon uptake are driven primarily by increases in
atmospheric CO~2~ (Figure 5.25). As a result, the evolution of land and
ocean carbon sinks differs significantly between the SSP scenarios.
Under scenarios that have greater increases in atmospheric CO~2~ (such
as SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0) the absolute values of the sinks are larger,
but the fraction of implied emissions taken up by the sinks declines
through the 21^st^ century. By contrast, scenarios that assume CO~2~
stabilization in the 21^st^ century (such as SSP1-2.6 or SSP2-4.5), have
smaller absolute sinks, but these sinks take up an increasing fraction
of the implied emissions (Figure 5.25d). These general principles apply
to the ocean and land carbon sinks.

The concentration-driven CMIP6 ESMs agree well on the evolution of the
global ocean carbon sink through the 21^st^ century for four SSP
scenarios (Figure 5.26). The five-year ensemble mean ocean sink declines
to 0.6 ± 0.2 GtC yr^–1^ by 2100 under SSP1-2.6, and peaks around 2080 at
5.4 ± 0.4 GtC yr^–1^ under SSP5-8.5. Cumulative ocean carbon uptake from
1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 290 ± 30 GtC under
SSP1-2.6, and to reach 520 ± 40 GtC by 2100 under SSP5-8.5 (Figure
5.26).

The ensemble mean changes in land and ocean sinks are qualitatively
similar, but the land shows much higher interannual variability in
carbon uptake (Figure 5.25c) and also a much larger spread in the model
projections of cumulative land carbon uptake (Figure 5.25f). The
five-year ensemble mean net land carbon sink is projected to decline to
0.4 ± 1.0 GtC yr^–1^ by 2100 under SSP1-2.6, and to reach around 5.6 ±
3.7 GtC yr^–1^ under SSP5-8.5 (Figure 5.25b). Cumulative net land carbon
uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 150 ± 35 GtC
under SSP1-2.6, and to reach 310 ± 130 GtC by 2100 under SSP5-8.5.
Significant uncertainty remains in the future of the global land carbon
sink, but there has been a notable reduction in the model spread from
CMIP5 to CMIP6.

    ± one standard deviation about that mean. The grey wedges represent
    estimates from the global carbon project (GCP), assuming
    uncertainties in the annual mean ocean and net land carbon sinks of
    0.5 GtC yr^-1^ and 1 GtC yr^-1^ respectively, and uncertainties in
    the changes in carbon stores (ocean, land and cumulative total
    emissions) of 25 GtC. The net land carbon sink is taken as net biome
    productivity (NBP) and so includes any modelled net land-use change
    emissions. Further details on data sources and processing are
    available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.25 HERE\] **

Geographical patterns of carbon changes for four SSP scenarios are shown
in Figure 5.26, with cleared areas (no diagonal lines) showing agreement
on the sign of the change by at least 80% of the models. In all
scenarios the ocean sink is strongest in the Southern Ocean and North
Atlantic. The land carbon sink occurs primarily where there are
present-day forests. In the mid- and high-northern latitudes, a carbon
sink is projected as a result of the combined impacts of increasing
CO~2~ and warming (Section 5.4.5.5). Changes in land carbon storage in
the tropics also depend strongly on the assumed rate of deforestation
which varies in magnitude across the SSPs, from relatively low rates in
SSP1-2.6 to relatively high rates in SSP3-7.0.

    Pathway (SSP) scenarios, as evaluated from nine CMIP6 Earth system
    models**. Uncertainty is represented using the simple approach (see
    Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 for more information): No overlay
    indicates regions with high model agreement, where ≥80% of models
    agree with the ensemble mean on the sign of change; diagonal lines
    indicate regions with low model agreement, where &lt;80% of models
    agree with the ensemble mean on the sign of change. On land, this is
    calculated as the time integral of NBP, for the ocean it is the
    time-integral of air-sea CO~2~ gas flux anomalies relative to the
    pre-industrial. Further details on data sources and processing are
    available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.26 HERE\]**

In summary, oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to
continue to grow with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO~2~,
but the fraction of emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to
decline as the CO~2~ concentration increases (*high confidence*). In the
ensemble mean, ESMs suggest approximately equal global land and ocean
carbon uptake for each of the SSP scenarios. However, the range of model
projections is much larger for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide
range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO~2~ by 2100 is
dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than carbon–climate

    Analysis

To diagnose the causes of the varying time-evolution of carbon sinks,
the traditional linear feedback approach is adopted (Friedlingstein et
al., 2003), as used previously to analyse C^4^MIP (Friedlingstein et
al., 2006) and CMIP5 models (Arora et al., 2013). Changes in land carbon
storage (*∆C*~L~) and changes in ocean carbon storage (*∆C*~o~) are
decomposed into contributions arising from warming (*∆T*) and increases
in CO~2~ (*∆CO~2~*):

$$C_{L} = \ \beta_{L}\text{\ Δ}\text{CO}_{2} + \ \gamma_{L}\text{\ ΔT}$$

$$C_{o} = \ \beta_{o}\text{\ Δ}\text{CO}_{2} + \ \gamma_{o}\text{\ ΔT}$$

where *β*~L~ (*β*~o~) and γ~L~ (γ~o~) are coefficients that represent
the sensitivity of land (ocean) carbon storage to changes in CO~2~ and
global mean temperature respectively. This feedback formalism is one of
several that have been proposed for analysing climate-carbon cycle
feedbacks (Lade et al., 2018).

This quasi-equilibrium framework is scenario dependent because of the
time scales associated with land and ocean carbon uptake, as discussed
in AR5 (WGI, Box 6.4). However, it is retained here for traceability
with AR5. This approach has been used to define a number of emergent
constraints on carbon cycle feedbacks (Section 5.4.6) and to reconstruct
the transient climate response to cumulative CO~2~ emissions (TCRE)
(Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), as in Section 5.5. To minimize the
confounding effect of the scenario dependence, *β* and *γ* values are
diagnosed from idealized runs in which a 1% per year increase in
atmospheric CO~2~ concentration is prescribed, as for AR5 (WGI, Box 6.4;
Arora et al., 2013). Values of *β *are calculated from ‘biogeochemical’
runs in which the prescribed CO~2~ increases do not affect climate, and
these are then used to isolate *γ* values in fully coupled runs where
both climate and CO~2~ change (Friedlingstein et al., 2003).

Table 5.5 shows the global land and global ocean values of *β* and *γ *
for each of the CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et al., 2020). The last two rows show
the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensemble means and standard deviations. In both
ensembles, the largest uncertainties are in the sensitivity of land
carbon storage to CO~2~ (*β*~L~) and the sensitivity of land carbon
storage to temperature (*γ*~L~). The more widespread modelling of
nitrogen limitations in CMIP6 was expected to lead to reductions in both
of these feedback parameters. There is some evidence for that, with
ensemble mean *γ*~L~ moving from –58 ± 38 GtC K^–1^ to –33 ± 33 GtC
K^–1^. Between CMIP5 and CMIP6, there are also reductions in ensemble
mean *β~o\ ~*(0.82 to 0.77 GtC ppm^–1^), *β*~L~ (0.93 to 0.89 GtC K^–1^)
and *γ*~o~ (–17.3 to –16.9 GtC K^–1^), but these are progressively less
significant compared to the model spread in each case.

In these idealized 1% per year CO~2~ runs, the CMIP6 models show
reasonable agreement on the patterns of carbon uptake and also on the
separate impacts of CO~2~ increase and climate change (Figure 5.27). For
the ensemble mean, increasing atmospheric CO~2~ increases carbon uptake
by the oceans, especially in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic
Ocean, and on the land, especially in tropical and boreal forests
(*β, *Figure 5.27a). Climate change further enhances land carbon storage
in the boreal zone, but has a compensating negative impact on the carbon
sink in tropical and subtropical lands, and in the North Atlantic Ocean
(*γ, *Figure 5.27b). Overall, the ensemble mean of the CMIP6 ESMs model
indicates increasing carbon storage with CO~2~ in almost all locations
(Figure 5.27c).

    feedback for the mean of the ensemble of models that include
    nitrogen is shown as dashed lines, and carbon-only models as

    changes are calculated as the difference between carbon stocks at

    surface air temperature. Further details on data sources and

### Emergent constraints to reduce uncertainties in projections {#emergent-constraints-to-reduce-uncertainties-in-projections .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Emergent constraints are based on relationships between observable
aspects of the current or past climate (such as trends or variability),
and uncertain aspects of future climate change (such as the strength of
particular feedbacks). These relationships are evident across an
ensemble of models. When combined with an observational estimate of the
trend or variability in the real climate, such emergent relationships
can yield ‘emergent constraints’ on future climate change (Hall et al.,
2019). At the time of AR5 (WGI, Section 9.8.3), there had been
relatively few applications of the technique to constrain carbon cycle
sensitivities, but there have been many studies published since (e.g.,
the summary in Cox, 2019). Figure 5.28 shows some key published emergent
constraints on the carbon cycle in ESMs.

**\[START FIGURE 5.28 HERE\]**

1.  **Examples of emergent constraints on the carbon cycle in Earth
    system models (ESMs)**, reproduced from previously published
    studies: (a) projected global mean atmospheric CO~2~ concentration
    by 2060 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario against the simulated
    CO~2~ in 2010 (Friedlingstein et al., 2014b; Hoffman et al.,
    2014); (b) sensitivity of tropical land carbon to warming (γ~LT~)
    against the sensitivity of the atmospheric CO~2~ growth-rate to
    tropical temperature variability (Cox et al., 2013; Wenzel et al.,
    2014); (c) sensitivity of extratropical (30^o^N–90^o^N) gross
    primary production to a doubling of atmospheric CO~2~ against the
    sensitivity of the amplitude of the CO~2~ seasonal cycle at Kumkahi,
    Hawaii to global atmospheric CO~2~ concentration (Wenzel et al.,
    2016); (d) change in high-latitude (30^o^N–90^o^N) gross primary
    production versus trend in high-latitude leaf area index or
    ‘greenness’ (Winkler et al., 2019); (e) sensitivity of the primary
    production of the Tropical ocean to climate change versus its
    sensitivity to ENSO-driven temperature variability (Kwiatkowski et
    al., 2017); (f) global ocean carbon sink in the 2090s versus the
    current-day carbon sink in the Southern Ocean. In each case, a

### Climate Feedbacks from CH~4~ and N~2~O  {#climate-feedbacks-from-ch4-and-n2o .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Sources and sinks of CH~4~ and N~2~O respond both directly and
indirectly to atmospheric CO~2~ concentration and climate change, and
thereby give rise to additional biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate
system, which may amplify or attenuate climate-carbon cycle feedbacks
(Gasser et al., 2017; Lade et al., 2018; Denisov et al., 2019). Many of
these of feedbacks are only partially understood, and thus were only
partially addressed in AR5 (WGI, Sections 6.3.3, 6.3.4 and 6.4.7). Since
AR5, a growing body of estimates from ESMs, as well as independent
modelling and observation-based studies, enable improved estimates of
the associated feedbacks.

The goal of this section is to assess the climate feedback parameters α,
as it is defined in Section 7.4.1.1, for CH~4~ and N~2~O biogeochemical
feedbacks. The strength of the feedbacks is estimated in a linear
framework (Gregory et al., 2009), using the radiative forcing equations
for CO~2~, CH~4~ and N~2~O (Etminan et al., 2016). In addition to
estimates from ESMs, the feedback parameter α is derived from
independent estimates of surface emission climate sensitivities and
atmospheric box models, following (Arneth et al., 2010; Thornhill et
al., 2020). These assessed feedback parameters are used in Section
7.4.2.5.

The CH~4~ feedbacks may arise from changing wetland emissions (including
rice farming) and from sources that are expected to grow under climate
change (e.g. related to permafrost thaw, fires, and freshwater bodies).
CH~4~ emissions from wetlands and landfills generally increase with
warming due to enhanced decomposition with higher temperatures, thereby
potentially providing a positive CH~4~ feedback on climate (Dean et al.,
2018). The contribution of wetlands to interannual variability of
atmospheric CH~4~ is shaped by the different impacts of temperature and
precipitation anomalies on wetland emissions (e.g. during El Niño
episodes) and therefore the relationship between climate anomalies and
the wetland contribution to the CH~4~ growth rate is complex (Pison et
al., 2013; Nisbet et al., 2016; X. Zhang et al., 2020). As assessed by
SROCC (IPCC, 2019b), there is *high agreement* across model simulations
that wetlands CH~4~ emissions will increase in the 21^st^ century, but
*low agreement* in the magnitude of the change (Denisov et al., 2013;
Shindell et al., 2013; B.D. Stocker et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017;
Koffi et al., 2020). Climate change increases wetland emissions (Gedney,
2004; Volodin, 2008; Ringeval et al., 2011; Denisov et al., 2013;
Shindell et al., 2013; Gedney et al., 2019) and gives rise to an
estimated wetland CH~4~–climate feedback of 0.03 ± 0.01 W m^–2^ °C^–1^
(mean ± 1 standard deviation; *limited evidence*, *high agreement*)
(Arneth et al., 2010; Shindell et al., 2013; B.D. Stocker et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2017). The effect of rising CO~2~ on productivity, and
therefore on the substrate for methanogenesis, can further increase the
projected increase in wetland CH~4~ emissions (Ringeval et al., 2011;
Melton et al., 2013). Model projections accounting for the combined
effects of CO~2~ and climate change suggest a potentially larger climate
feedback (0.01–0.16 W m^–2^ °C^–1^) (*limited evidence*, *limited
agreement*) (Gedney et al., 2019; Thornhill et al., 2020). Methane
release from wetlands depends on the nutrient availability for
methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms that can further modify
this feedback (Stepanenko et al., 2016; Donis et al., 2017; Beaulieu et
al., 2019). Methane emissions from thermokarst ponds and wetlands
resulting from permafrost thaw are estimated to contribute an additional
CH~4~-climate feedback of 0.01 \[0.003–0.04, 5–95th percentile range\] W
m^–2^ °C^–1^ (*limited evidence, moderate agreement*). 

Methane release from wildfires may increase by up to a factor of 1.5
during the 21^st^ century (Eliseev et al., 2014a, b; Kloster and
Lasslop, 2017). However, given the contemporary estimate for CH~4~ from
wildfires of no more than 16 TgCH~4~ yr^–1^ (van der Werf et al., 2017;
Saunois et al., 2020), this feedback is small, adding no more than 40
ppb to the atmospheric CH~4~ by the end of the 21^st^ century (*medium
confidence*). Methane emissions from pan-Arctic freshwater bodies is
also estimated to increase by 16 TgCH~4~ yr^–1^ in the 21^st^ century
(Tan and Zhuang, 2015). Emissions from subsea and permafrost methane
hydrates are not expected to change substantially in the 21^st^ century
(Section 5.4.8).

Land biosphere models show *high agreement* that long-term warming will
increase N~2~O release from terrestrial ecosystems (Xu-Ri et al., 2012;
B.D. Stocker et al., 2013; Zaehle, 2013; Tian et al., 2019). A positive
land N~2~O climate feedback is consistent with paleo-evidence based on
reconstructed and modelled emissions during the last deglacial period
(Schilt et al., 2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019; Joos et al., 2020). The
response of terrestrial N~2~O emissions to atmospheric CO~2~ increase
and associated warming is dependent on nitrogen availability (van
Groenigen et al., 2011; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Tian et al.,
2019). Model-based estimates do not account for the potentially strong
emission increases in boreal and arctic ecosystems associated with
future warming and permafrost thaw (Elberling et al., 2010; Voigt et
al., 2017). There is *medium confidence* that the land N~2~O climate
feedback is positive, but *low confidence* in the magnitude (0.02 ± 0.01
W m^–2^ °C^–1^).

Climate change will also affect N~2~O production in the ocean
(Codispoti, 2010; Freing et al., 2012; Bopp et al., 2013; Rees et al.,
2016; Breider et al., 2019). Model projections in the 21^st^ century
show a 4–12% decrease in ocean N~2~O emissions under RCP8.5 due to a
combination of factors, including increased ocean stratification,
decreased ocean productivity, and the impact of increasing atmospheric
N~2~O abundance on the air-sea flux, corresponding to an ocean N~2~O
climate feedback of –0.008 ± 0.002 W m^–2^ °C^–1^ (*high agreement,
limited evidence*) (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017;
Battaglia and Joos, 2018b). On millennial time scales, the ocean N~2~O
climate feedback may be positive, owing to ocean deoxygenation and
long-term increases in remineralization (Battaglia and Joos, 2018b).

Based-on these studies, there is *medium confidence* that the combined
climate feedback parameter for CH~4~ and N~2~O is positive, but there is
*low confidence* in the magnitude of the estimate (0.05 (0.02–0.09) W
m^–2^ °C^–1^, 5–95th percentile range). 

### Combined Biogeochemical Climate Feedback  {#combined-biogeochemical-climate-feedback .AR6Chap5Level2511}

This section assesses the magnitude of the combined biogeochemical
feedback in the climate system (Figure 5.29) by integrating evidence
from: carbon-cycle projections represented in Earth system models (ESMs)
(Section 5.4.5.5), independent estimates of CO~2~ emissions due to
permafrost thaw (Box 5.1) and fire (Section 5.4.3.2), natural CH~4~ and
N~2~O emissions (Section 5.4.7), and aerosol and atmospheric chemistry
(Section 6.3.6). We derive a physical climate feedback parameter α, as
defined in Section 7.4.1.1, for CO~2~-based feedbacks using the linear
framework proposed by Gregory et al. (2009), using the radiative forcing
equations for CO~2~ (Etminan et al., 2016).

**\[START FIGURE 5.29 HERE\]**

    where $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ is the change in TOA energy

**\[END FIGURE 5.29 HERE\] **

The climate feedback parameter for CO~2~ (–1.13 ± 0.45 W m^–2^ °C^–1,^
mean and 1 standard-deviation range) is dominated by the contribution of
the CO~2~-induced increase of ocean and land carbon storage (–1.46 ±
0.41 W m^–2^ °C^–1^, corresponding to a *β*~L+O~ of 1.66 ± 0.31 PgC
ppm^–1^), with smaller contributions from the carbon cycle’s response to
climate (0.24 ± 0.17 W m^–2^ °C^–1^, corresponding to γ~L+O~ of –50 ± 34
PgC °C^–1^), and emissions from permafrost thaw (0.09 \[0.02–0.20\] W
m^–2^ °C^–1^, corresponding to γ of –18 \[3–41\] PgC °C^–1^, mean and
5–95th percentile range) (Figure 5.29a). This estimate does not include
an estimate of the fire-related CO~2~ feedback (range: 0.01–0.06 W m^–2^
°C^–1^), as only limited evidence was available to inform its
assessment. The sum (mean and 5–95th percentile range) of feedbacks from
natural emissions of CH~4~ including permafrost thaw, and N~2~O (0.05
\[0.02–0.09\] W m^–2^ °C^–1^), and feedbacks from aerosol and
atmospheric chemistry (–0.20 \[–0.41 to 0.01\] W m^–2^ °C^–1^) leads to
an estimate of the non-CO~2~ biogeochemical feedback parameter of –0.15
\[–0.36 to +0.06\] W m^–2^ °C^–1^. There is *low confidence* in the
estimate of the non-CO~2~ biogeochemical feedbacks, due to the large
range in the estimates of α for some individual feedbacks (Figure
5.29c), which can be attributed to the diversity in how models account
for these feedbacks, limited process-level understanding, and the
existence of known feedbacks where there is insufficient evidence to
assess the feedback strength.

CO~2~ and non-CO~2~ biogeochemical feedbacks are an important component
of the assessment of TCRE and the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5).
The feedbacks of the carbon cycle of CO~2~ and climate are implicitly
taken account in the TCRE assessment, because they are represented in
the various underlying lines of evidence. Other feedback contributions,
such as the non-CO~2~ biogeochemical feedback, can be converted into a
carbon-equivalent feedback term (γ; Section 5.4.5.5, 7.6) by reverse
application of the linear feedback approximation (Gregory et al., 2009).
The contributions of non-CO~2~ biogeochemical feedbacks combine to a
linear feedback term of 30 ± 27 PgCeq °C^–1^ (1 standard deviation
range, 111 ± 98 Gt CO~2~eq °C^–1^), including a feedback term of –11
(–18 to –5) PgCeq °C^–1^ (5–95th percentile range, –40 (–62 to –18) Gt
CO~2~eq °C^–1^) from natural CH~4~ and N~2~O sources. The biogeochemical
feedback from permafrost thaw leads to a combined linear feedback term
of –21 ± 12 PgCeq °C^–1^ (1 standard deviation range –77 ± 44 Gt CO~2~eq
°C^–1^). For the integration of these feedbacks in the assessment of the
remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5.2), two individual non-CO~2~
feedbacks (tropospheric ozone, and methane lifetime) are captured in the
AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1). Excluding those two contributions,
the resulting combined linear feedback term for application in Section
5.5.2 is assessed at a reduction of 7 ± 27 PgCeq °C^–1^ (1 standard
deviation range, –26 ± 97 PgCeq °C^–1^). For the same reasons as for the
feedback terms expressed in W m^–2^ °C^–1^ (see above), there is overall
*low confidence* in the magnitude of these feedbacks.

### Abrupt Changes and Tipping Points {#abrupt-changes-and-tipping-points .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The applicability of the linear feedback framework (Section 5.4.5.5)
suggests that large-scale biogeochemical feedbacks are approximately
linear in the forcing from changes in CO~2~ and climate. Nevertheless,
regionally the biosphere is known to be capable of producing abrupt
changes or even ‘tipping points’ (Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et
al., 2016). Abrupt change is defined as a change in the system that is
substantially faster than the typical rate of the changes in its history
(Section 1.4.5). A related matter is a tipping point: a critical
threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or
irreversibly. Possible abrupt changes in the Earth system include those
related to ecosystems and biogeochemistry (Lenton et al., 2008; Steffen
et al., 2018): tropical and boreal forest dieback; and release of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) from permafrost and methane clathrates (Table
5.6). It is not currently possible to carry out a full assessment of
proposed abrupt changes and tipping points in the biogeochemical cycles.
In this section we therefore focus on estimating upper limits on the
possible impact of abrupt changes on the evolution of atmospheric GHGs
out to 2100, for comparison to the impact of direct anthropogenic
emissions.

    points in the Earth system**. The fourth and sixth comments provide
    upper estimates of the impact of each example on the evolution of
    atmospheric GHGs in the 21^st^ century. These upper estimates are
    therefore *very unlikely* but provide a useful comparison to the
    impact of direct anthropogenic emissions (currently 2.5 ppm yr^–1^).

##### Forest dieback  {#forest-dieback .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Published examples of abrupt biogeochemical changes in models include
tropical rain forest dieback (Cox et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2009;
Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), and
temperate and boreal forest dieback (Joos et al., 2001; Lucht et al.,
2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Section 5.4.3). Such
transitions may be related to: (i) large-scale changes in mean climate
conditions crossing particular climate thresholds (Joos et al., 2001;
Cox et al., 2004; Lucht et al., 2006; Hirota et al., 2011; Scheffer et
al., 2012; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017); (ii) temperature
and precipitation extremes (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter,
2012; Scheffer et al., 2012; Pavlov, 2015; Zemp et al., 2017); or (iii)
possible enhancement and intermittency in fire activity (Staver et al.,
2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Brando et al.,
2020). Simulated changes in forest cover are a combination of the
effects of CO~2~ on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (Section
5.4.1), and the effects of climate change on photosynthesis, respiration
and disturbance (Section 5.4.3). In ESMs, direct CO~2~ effects tend to
enhance forest growth, but the impacts of climate change vary between
being predominantly negative in the tropics and predominantly positive
in the boreal zone (Figure 5.27).

Most ESMs project continuing carbon accumulation in tropical forests as
a result of direct CO~2~ effects overwhelming the negative effects of
climate change (Huntingford et al., 2013; Drijfhout et al., 2015;
Boulton et al., 2017). In the real world, forests may be less vulnerable
to climate changes than those modelled in ESMs because of the greater
plant trait diversity which confers additional resilience (Reyer et al.,
2015; Levine et al., 2016; Sakschewski et al., 2016), and also because
of possible acclimation of vegetation to warming (Good et al., 2011,
2013; Lloret et al., 2012; Mercado et al., 2018). Contrary, forests may
be more vulnerable in the real world due to indirect climate change
effects such as insect outbreaks and diseases not considered here
(Section 5.4.3.2) or model limitations in representing the effects
disturbances such as wildfire and droughts. In general, forests are most
vulnerable when climate change is combined with increased rates of
direct deforestation (Nobre et al., 2016; Le Page et al., 2017).

To estimate an upper limit on the impact of Amazon forest dieback on
atmospheric CO~2~, we consider the *very unlikely* limiting case of
negligible direct-CO~2~ effects (Section 5.4.1). Emergent constraint
approaches (Section 5.4.6) may be used to estimate an overall loss of
tropical land carbon due to climate change alone, of around 50 PgC per
^o^C of tropical warming (Cox et al., 2013; Wenzel et al., 2014). This
implies an upper limit to the release of tropical land carbon of &lt;200
PgC over the 21^st^ century (assuming tropical warming of &lt;4^o^C*,*
and no CO~2~-fertilization), which translates to dCO~2~/dt &lt; 0.5 ppm
yr^–1^.

Boreal forest dieback is not expected to change the atmospheric CO~2~
concentration substantially because forest loss at the south is partly
compensated by: (i) temperate forest invasion into the previous boreal
area; and (ii) boreal forest gain at the north (Friend et al., 2014;
Kicklighter et al., 2014; Schaphoff et al., 2016) (*medium confidence*).
An upper estimate of this magnitude, based on statistical modelling of
climate change alone, is of 27 Pg vegetation C loss in the southern
boreal forest, which is roughly balanced by gains in the northern zone
(Koven, 2013). Carbon release from vegetation and soil due to wildfires
in boreal regions (Eliseev et al., 2014b; Turetsky et al., 2015; A.P.
Walker et al., 2019) is also not expected to change this estimate
substantially because of its small present-day value of about 0.2 PgC
yr^–1^ (van der Werf et al., 2017), and because of *likely* increases in
precipitation in boreal regions (Section 4.5.1).

##### Biogenic emissions following permafrost thaw {#biogenic-emissions-following-permafrost-thaw .AR6Chap5Level451111}

There is large uncertainty in release of GHGs from permafrost in the
21^st^ century. The largest of these estimates implies tens to hundreds
of gigatons of carbon released in the form of CO~2~ (Box 5.1) and
methane emissions up to 100 TgCH~4~ yr^–1^ (Box 5.1). A release of such
magnitude would lead to an increase in the CO~2~ accumulation rate in
the atmosphere of ≤1 ppm yr^–1^. These emissions develop at a
multi-decadal time scale. Assuming a CH~4~ lifetime in the atmosphere of
the order of 10 years and the associated feedback parameter of 1.34 ±
0.04 (Section 6.2.2.1), this would increase the atmospheric CH~4~
content by about 500 ppb over the century, corresponding to a rate of
≤10 ppb yr ^1^. Irrespective of its origin, additional CH~4~
accumulation of such a magnitude is not expected to modify the
temperature response to anthropogenic emissions by more than a few tens
of °C cent (Gedney, 2004; Eliseev et al., 2008; Denisov et al., 2013).
Emissions from the permafrost are assessed in Box 5.1.

##### Methane release from clathrates {#methane-release-from-clathrates .AR6Chap5Level451111}

The total global clathrate reservoir is estimated to contain 1500–2000
PgC (Archer et al., 2009; Ruppel and Kessler, 2017), held predominantly
in ocean sediments, with only an estimated 20 PgC in and under
permafrost (Ruppel, 2015). The present-day methane release from shelf
clathrates is &lt;10 TgCH~4~ yr^–1^ (Kretschmer et al., 2015; Saunois et
al., 2020). Despite polar amplification (Chapter 7), substantial
releases from the permafrost-embedded subsea clathrates is *very
unlikely* (Minshull et al., 2016; Malakhova and Eliseev, 2017, 2020).
This is consistent with an overall small release of methane from the
shelf clathrates during the last deglacial, despite large
reorganizations in climate state (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al.,
2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). The long time scales associated with
clathrate destabilization makes it *unlikely* that CH~4~ release from
the ocean to the atmosphere will deviate markedly from the present-day
value through the 21^st^ century (Hunter et al., 2013), corresponding to
no more than additional 20 ppb of atmospheric methane (i.e., &lt;0.2 ppb
yr^–1^). Another possible source of CH~4~ is gas clathrates in deeper
terrestrial permafrost and below it (Buldovicz et al., 2018; Chuvilin et
al., 2018), which may have caused recent craters in the north of Russia
(Arzhanov et al., 2016, 2020; Arzhanov and Mokhov, 2017; Kizyakov et
al., 2017, 2018). Land clathrates are formed at depths &gt;200 m (Ruppel
and Kessler, 2017; Malakhova and Eliseev, 2020), which precludes a
substantial response to global warming over the next few centuries and
associated emissions.

Thus, it is *very unlikely* that CH~4~ emissions from clathrates will
substantially warm the climate system over the next few centuries.

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535715 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564300 .anchor}Abrupt Changes
    Detected in Earth System Model Projections

Projecting abrupt changes is intrinsically difficult, because by
definition abrupt changes occur in a small region of the parameter
and/or forcing space. At the time of AR5 there was no available
systematic study of abrupt changes or tipping points in Earth system
models (ESMs). An analysis of ESMs since AR5 has identified a number of
abrupt changes in the CMIP5 ensemble (Drijfhout et al., 2015; Bathiany
et al., 2020). These include abrupt changes in tropical forests and
high-latitude greening, permafrost thaw, and vegetation composition
change (Bathiany et al., 2020). Most modelled abrupt changes were
detected in boreal and tundra regions, with few models showing Amazon
forest dieback (Bathiany et al., 2020).

Based on the evidence presented in this section, we conclude that abrupt
changes and tipping points in the biogeochemical cycles lead to
additional uncertainty in 21^st^ century GHG concentrations changes.
However, these are *very likely* to be small compared to the uncertainty
associated with future anthropogenic emissions (*high confidence*).

### Long-Term Response Past 2100 {#long-term-response-past-2100 .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The AR5 assessed with *very high confidence* that the carbon cycle in
the ocean and on land will continue to respond to climate change and
rising atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations created during the 21^st^
century (WGI, Chapter 6, Executive Summary). Since AR5, experiments with
the CESM1 model under the RCP8.5 extension scenario to 2300, suggest
that both land and ocean carbon–climate feedbacks strengthen in time,
land and ocean carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken, and the relative
importance of ocean sinks versus land sinks increases (Randerson et al.,
2015). Under high emissions scenarios, this relative strengthening of
land carbon–climate feedbacks leads the terrestrial biosphere to shift
from sink to source at some point after 2100 in all of the CMIP5 ESMs
and CMIP5-era Earth models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) (Tokarska
et al., 2016). The strengthening of land and ocean carbon–climate
feedbacks projected beyond 2100 under high emissions scenarios offsets
the declining climate sensitivity to incremental increases of CO~2~,
leading to a net strengthening of carbon cycle feedbacks, as measured by
the gain parameter, from one century to the next (Randerson et al.,
2015).

Figure 5.30 shows carbon cycle changes to 2300 under three SSP scenarios
with long-term extensions: SSP5-8.5, SSP5-3.4-overshoot, and SSP1-2.6,
for four CMIP6 ESMs and one EMIC. Under all three scenarios, all five
models project a reversal of the terrestrial carbon cycle from a sink to
a source. However, the reasons for these reversals under very high
emissions and low/negative emissions are very different. Under the
SSP5-8.5 scenario, the terrestrial carbon–climate feedback is projected
to strengthen, while the carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken after
emissions peak at 2100, which together drives the land to become a net
carbon source after 2100 (Tokarska et al., 2016). The difference in both
timing and magnitude of this transition across the ensemble, leads to an
assessment of *medium confidence* in the likelihood and *low confidence*
in the timing and strength, of the land transitioning from a net sink to
a net source under such a scenario. Based on *high agreement* across all
available models, we assess with *high confidence* that the ocean sink
strength would weaken but not reverse under a long-term high emissions
scenario. In the SSP5-3.4-overshoot scenario, both the terrestrial and
ocean reservoirs act as transient carbon sources during the overshoot
period, when net anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions are negative and CO~2~
concentrations are falling, and then revert to near-zero (land) or weak
sink (ocean) fluxes after stabilization of atmospheric CO~2~. The
SSP1-2.6 scenario, characterized by lower peak CO~2~ concentrations, a
smaller overshoot, and much less carbon loss from land-use change, shows
instead a relaxation towards a neutral biosphere on land, and a
sustained weak sink in the ocean (see also Section 5.6.2.2.1.2).

### Near-term Prediction of Ocean and Land Carbon Sinks {#near-term-prediction-of-ocean-and-land-carbon-sinks .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The AR5 (WGI, Section 11.3.2) assessed near-term climate predictability
based on ESMs initialized from the observed climate state. Since AR5, a
growing number of prediction systems have been developed based on ESMs
that include the ocean and land carbon cycle components. Predictability
of key physical climate variables (assessed in Chapter 4) provides a
platform to establish predictive skill for interannual variations in the
strength of the natural carbon sinks in response to internal climate
variability. In most systems the carbon cycle components are only
indirectly initialized and respond to the initialized climate variations
(Li et al., 2019). This subsection synthesizes information on
predictability of the land and ocean carbon sinks using both the
idealized potential predictability and the actual predictability skill
measures.

Longer-term memory residing in the ocean enables predictability of the
ocean carbon sink (McKinley et al., 2017; Li and Ilyina, 2018). The
predictive horizon of the globally integrated air-sea CO~2~ fluxes has
been assessed in perfect-model frameworks that are based on an idealized
ensemble of simulations in which each ensemble member serves as a
verification, while no observations are assessed. Perfect-model studies
provide an estimate of the upper range of potential predictability for
the integrated air-sea CO~2~ fluxes of about two years globally and up
to a decade in some regions (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina,
2020). Evidence is also emerging for predictive skill of the global
air-sea CO~2~ fluxes of up to six years based on prediction systems
initialized with observed physical climate states (Li et al., 2019),
with a potential for even longer-term regional predictability in some
regions, including the North Atlantic and subpolar Southern Ocean (H. Li
et al., 2016; Lovenduski et al., 2019a).

Models suggest that predictability of the air-sea CO~2~ flux is related
to predictability of ocean biogeochemical state variables such as
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA; Lovenduski et
al., 2019a), as well as the mixed layer depth (H. Li et al., 2016).
Temperature variations largely control shorter-term predictability of
the ocean carbon sink, while longer-term predictability is related to
non-thermal drivers such as ocean circulation and biology (Li et al.,
2019). Although there is a substantial spatial heterogeneity,
initialized predictions suggest stronger multi-year variations of the
air-sea CO~2~ flux and generally tend to outperform uninitialized
simulations on the global scale (Li et al., 2019). The predictive skill
of air-sea CO~2~ flux shows a consistent spatial pattern in different
models, despite the wide range of techniques used to assimilate
observational information (Regnier et al., 2013a). ESM-based prediction
systems also demonstrate predictability of other marine biogeochemical
properties such as net primary production (Séférian et al., 2014; Yeager
et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019) and seawater pH (Brady et al., 2020).

Seasonal predictability of air-land CO~2~ flux up to 6–8 months is
driven by the state of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Zeng et al.,
2008; Betts et al., 2018). Fewer land carbon initialized predictions are
available from decadal prediction systems, yet they tend to outperform
the uninitialized simulations in capturing the major year-to-year
variations, as indicated by higher correlations with the global carbon
budget estimates. There is growing evidence that the potential
predictive skill of air-land CO~2~ flux is maintained out to a lead-time
of two years (Lovenduski et al., 2019b); this predictability horizon is
also supported by perfect model studies (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring
and Ilyina, 2020). The origins of this interannual predictability are
not yet fully understood. However, they seem to be associated with the
oscillatory behaviour of ENSO (Séférian et al., 2014) and the
predictability of terrestrial ecosystem drivers such as ecosystem
respiration and gross primary production (Lovenduski et al., 2019a).
Initialized simulations suggest that observed variability in the land
carbon sink is improved through initialization of prediction systems
with the observed state of the physical climate.

The predictability horizon of variations in atmospheric CO~2~ growth
rate is not yet fully established in the literature. However, predictive
skill of the land and ocean carbon sinks show a potential to establish
predictability of variations in atmospheric CO~2~ up to two years in
advance in the initialized prediction systems, with an upper bound of up
to three years in a perfect-model study (Spring and Ilyina, 2020); this
skill is primarily limited by the terrestrial carbon sink
predictability.

Remaining Carbon Budgets  {#remaining-carbon-budgets .AR6Chap5Level151}
-------------------------

Science at the time of AR5 established a near-linear relationship
between cumulative emissions of CO~2~ and the resulting global warming
(Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009;
Zickfeld et al., 2009; M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al.,
2013). The amount of global warming per unit of cumulated carbon dioxide
emissions is called the transient climate response to cumulative CO~2~
emissions (TCRE). This TCRE relationship is now used to estimate the
amount of CO~2~ emissions that would be consistent with limiting global
warming to specific levels (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009,
2012; Meinshausen et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 2009; M. Collins et
al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015; Rogelj et
al., 2016, 2019; Goodwin et al., 2018). The remainder of CO~2~ emissions
that would be in line with limiting global warming to a specific
temperature level (while accounting for all other factors affecting
global warming) can be estimated with the help of the TCRE and is
referred to as the remaining carbon budget (Rogelj et al., 2019;
Matthews et al., 2020). Section 5.5.1 first assesses the TCRE as one of
the core concepts underlying the notion of a remaining carbon budget,
and Section 5.5.2 then integrates this with other contributing factors
to provide a consolidated assessment following the approach of the
IPCC’s SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). The historical carbon budget of
CO~2~ already emitted is assessed in Section 5.2.1.5.

### Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions of Carbon Dioxide (TCRE)  {#transient-climate-response-to-cumulative-emissions-of-carbon-dioxide-tcre .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The processes that translate emissions of CO~2~ into a change in global
temperature (terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptake, radiative forcing
from CO~2~, and ocean heat uptake) are governed by complex mechanisms
that all evolve in time (Sections 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, 5.4, and 7.3, and
Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Gregory et al., 2009). Starting with an initial
description in AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013)
a body of literature has since expanded the understanding of physical
mechanisms from which a simple proportional relationship between
cumulative emissions of CO~2~ and change in global temperature arises –
expressed in either global mean surface temperature (GMST) or global
surface air temperature (GSAT).

Studies have focused on two key features of the transient climate
response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) relationship: (i) why the
relationship is nearly constant in time (Goodwin et al., 2015;
MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Ehlert et
al., 2017; Katavouta et al., 2018); and (ii) why, and under which
conditions, the relationship is independent of the historical rate (or
pathway) of CO~2~ emissions (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017).

There is increased confidence in the near-constancy of TCRE because of
the variety of methods that have been used to examine this relationship:
sensitivity studies with Earth system models (ESMs) of Earth models of
intermediate complexity (EMICs; Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Ehlert et
al., 2017); theory-based equations used to examine ESM and EMIC output
[]{#_Hlk74846597 .anchor}(Goodwin et al., 2015; R.G. Williams et al.,
2016, 2017b); and simple analytical models that capture aspects of the
TCRE relationship (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015). All studies
agree that the near-constancy of the TCRE arises from compensation
between the diminishing sensitivity of radiative forcing to CO~2~ at
higher atmospheric concentration, and the diminishing ability of the
ocean to take up heat and carbon at higher cumulative emissions (Allen
et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; Frölicher and Paynter, 2015;
Goodwin et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2015; MacDougall and
Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 2016; Tokarska et al., 2016; Ehlert et
al., 2017).

The question of whether, and under which conditions, the TCRE
relationship is independent of the historical rate of CO~2~ emissions
(also referred to as ‘pathway independence of TCRE’) has been examined
by using simple mathematically tractable models (MacDougall, 2017;
Seshadri, 2017). Based on the assumption that the cumulative fraction of
carbon taken up by the terrestrial biosphere is constant, and that the
climate feedback parameter and ocean heat uptake efficacy do not change
in time, both studies agree that pathway independence is sensitive to
the rate of CO~2~ emissions, such that pathway independence is expected
to break down at both very high and very low absolute CO~2~ emission
rates (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017). Note that, in pathways with
strongly declining emissions, the cumulative sink fraction by the
combined terrestrial biosphere and ocean is expected to increase (Figure
5.25). The studies also agree that no similar relationship analogous to
TCRE can be expected for short-lived non-CO~2~ forcers, for which the
annual emissions are a closer proxy for the implied warming (M. Collins
et al., 2013 ; Sections 6.4, 7.6). MacDougall (2017) suggests that two
additional constraints are required to create pathway independence:
first, the transport of heat and carbon into the deep ocean should be
governed by processes with similar time scales; and second, the ratio of
the net change in the atmospheric carbon pool to the net change in the
ocean carbon pool should be close to the ratio of the enhanced longwave
radiation to space (i.e., the radiative response of the surface) to
ocean heat uptake. If these ratios are identical, then TCRE would be
completely path independent (MacDougall, 2017). If the ratios are close
but not identical, TCRE would be only approximately path independent
over a wide range of cumulative emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3;
MacDougall, 2017).

The land carbon cycle does not appear to play a fundamental role in the
origin of the linearity and path-independence of TCRE (Goodwin et al.,
2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Ehlert et al., 2017) but, in
contrast to the ocean sink, dominates the uncertainty in the magnitude
of TCRE by modulating the cumulative airborne fraction of carbon
(Goodwin et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Katavouta et al., 2018;
Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Some terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks
(such as the permafrost carbon feedback; Section 5.4.8, Box 5.1) have
the potential to alter both the linearity and pathway independence of
TCRE, if such feedbacks significantly contribute carbon to the
atmosphere (Sections 5.5.1.2.3 and 5.4.8, and Box 5.1; MacDougall and
Friedlingstein, 2015;). A recent study also shows how the value of TCRE
can depend on the effect of ocean ventilation modulating ocean heat
uptake (Katavouta et al., 2019).

*Context*

In the past 60 years, the ocean has taken up and stored 23 ± 5% of
anthropogenic carbon emissions (*medium confidence*) (Section 5.2.1.3)
as well as more than 90% of the heat that has accumulated in the Earth
system (referred to as excess heat) since the 1970s (Sections 7.2.2,
9.2.2 and 9.2.3, and Box 7.2; Frölicher et al., 2015; Talley et al.,
2016; Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). The interplay between
heat and CO~2~ uptake by the ocean has played a major role in slowing
the rate of global warming, and also provides a first order influence in
determining the unique properties of a metric of the coupled
climate-carbon cycle response – transient climate response to cumulative
CO~2~ emissions (TCRE) – which is critical to setting the future
remaining carbon emissions budget (Sections 5.5.1.3 and 5.5.4). This
role of the ocean in the uptake of heat and anthropogenic CO~2~ and
related feedbacks is what we term the ‘Ocean Heat-Carbon Nexus’. The
ocean processes behind this nexus are important in shaping and
understanding the near-linear relationship between cumulative CO~2~
emissions and global warming (TCRE) as well as the uncertainties in
future projections of TCRE properties (Zickfeld et al., 2016; Bronselaer
and Zanna, 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), its path independence
(MacDougall, 2017), and the warming commitment after cessation of
greenhouse gas emissions – the zero emissions commitment (ZEC; Section
5.5.2; Zickfeld et al., 2016; Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2017). In this box,
we assess the role of the ocean and its physical and chemical
thermodynamic processes that shape these striking characteristics.

The role of the ocean in setting the coupled climate-carbon cycle
response is threefold. First, the ocean and land carbon sinks together
set the airborne fraction (AF) of CO~2~ in the atmosphere, which sets
the radiative forcing that drives the additional heat in the atmosphere,
most of which is taken up by the ocean (Sections 7.2 and 9.2; Katavouta
et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019). However, the land carbon sink does
not appear to play an important role in determining the linearity and
path-independence of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.1; Goodwin et al., 2015;
MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Ehlert et al., 2017). Second, the
ocean sets the thermal response through ocean heat uptake (Section 9.2;
Frölicher et al., 2015; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). Third, there is a
feedback within the ocean heat-carbon nexus as ocean warming,
particularly under low or no mitigation scenarios, weakens the ocean
sink of CO~2~, which influences the AF, and hence the radiative forcing
(Box 7.1; Williams et al., 2019). The near-linear relationship between
cumulative CO~2~ emissions and global warming (TCRE) is thought to
arise, to a large extent, from the compensation between the decreasing
ability of the ocean to take up heat and CO~2~ at higher cumulative
CO~2~ emissions, pointing to similar processes that determine ocean
uptake of heat and carbon (Section 5.5.1.1; Goodwin et al., 2015;
MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Zickfeld et
al., 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017).

*Processes* *that drive the ocean carbon-heat nexus and its change*

The air-sea flux of heat and all gases across the ocean interface is
driven by a common set of complex and turbulent diffusion and mixing
processes that are difficult to observe (Sections 5.2.1.3 and 9.2.1.2;
Wanninkhof et al., 2009; Wanninkhof, 2014; Cronin et al., 2019; Watson
et al., 2020). These processes are typically simplified into widely
verified expressions that link the flux to wind stress, the solubility
and the gradient across the air-sea interface (*medium confidence*).
Because the ocean has a higher heat capacity than the atmosphere (the
heat capacity of the upper 100 m of the ocean is about 30 times larger
than the heat capacity of the atmosphere), the partitioning of heat
between the atmosphere and the ocean is primarily influenced by the
temperature differences between air and seawater. Similarly, the unique
seawater carbonate buffering capacity, enables CO~2~ to be stored in the
ocean as dissolved salts, rather than just as dissolved gas. This
increases the capacity of seawater to store CO~2~ by two orders of
magnitude beyond the solubility of CO~2~ gas, and approximates the
partitioning ratio of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean (Section
9.2.2.1; Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2009; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). The
role of the biological carbon pump in influencing the ocean sink of
anthropogenic carbon into the ocean interior is assessed to be minimal
during the historical period, but this may change, particularly in
regional contexts, by 2100 (*medium confidence*) (Laufkötter et al.,
2015; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Its role is important in the natural or
pre-industrial carbon cycle (*medium confidence*) (Henson et al., 2016).

Under climate change, the buffering capacity of the ocean decreases
(increasing Revelle Factor), which reflects a decreasing capacity for
the ocean to take up additional anthropogenic CO~2~ and store it in the
dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir (Egleston et al., 2010). In
contrast to CO~2~, there is no physical limitation that would reduce the
ability of surface ocean temperature to equilibrate with the atmospheric
temperature. However, both carbon and heat fluxes are influenced by
air-sea heat fluxes that depend on gradients of characteristics at the
air-sea interface. These gradients respond to ocean dynamics, such as
the volume of the surface mixed-layer that equilibrates with the
atmosphere, and ocean circulation that can flush the surface layer with
water masses that have not equilibrated with the atmosphere for a long
time. Limited recent evidence suggests that the effect of small-scale
dynamics absent in climate and Earth system models might be locally
important (Bachman and Klocker, 2020). In summary, changes in heat and
carbon uptake by the ocean rely on a combination of unique chemical and
shared physical processes, any of which have the potential to disrupt
the coherence of heat and CO~2~ change in the ocean.

*Spatial pattern of air-sea fluxes and storage*

Large-scale regional and global ocean circulation shape the spatial
pattern of the uptake and storage of both CO~2~ and heat (see Figure 5.8
for carbon; Figure 9.6 for heat observations; Section 9.2; Frölicher et
al., 2015; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). This coherence of spatial
patterns driven by the large-scale ocean circulation has three aspects.
First, notwithstanding interannual-decadal variability in heat and CO~2~
uptake, there is a spatial coherence of the temporally integrated uptake
at the air-sea boundary, particularly in the Southern Ocean
(Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Talley et al., 2016; Keppler and
Landschützer, 2019; Auger et al., 2021). Second, the importance of the
meridional overturning circulation in the subsequent storage of both
heat and CO~2~ in mode, intermediate and deep waters of the ocean
interior (Section 9.2). Third, of particular note, the roles of the
North Atlantic Ocean (Section 9.2.3.1) and the Southern Ocean (Section
9.2.3.2) in linking the spatial pattern of air-sea fluxes, the storage
of heat and carbon, and ultimately in understanding and predicting the
sensitivity of the carbon-heat nexus to climate change (Frölicher et
al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019).

**\[START CROSS-CHAPTER BOX 5.3, FIGURE 1 HERE\]**

**Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1: CMIP6 multi-model mean of changes in
zonally integrated (a) carbon and (b) heat storage in ocean** **between
the pre-industrial and the modern period**. Carbon corresponds to
dissolved inorganic carbon. Data are shown for the upper 2000m. The
modern period is 1995–2014. Adapted from Frölicher et al., 2015).

**\[END CROSS-CHAPTER BOX 5.3, FIGURE 1 HERE\]**

The role of the large-scale circulation in shaping these fluxes is to:
(i) flush the ocean surface layer with deep waters that are relatively
cold and with weak or no anthropogenic CO~2~ and heat content because
they have been isolated from the atmosphere for centuries; and (ii)
transport the anthropogenic CO~2~ and heat at depth, away from the
atmosphere (Frölicher et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2015; Armour et
al., 2016). For instance, in the Southern Ocean, upwelled water masses
take up a large amount of anthropogenic CO~2~ and heat (Cross-Chapter
Box 5.3, Figure 1), which are then exported northward by the circulation
to be stored at depth in the Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyres
(Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Figure 9.7). In the North Atlantic,
the signature of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)
is also clearly visible, with large amounts of heat and carbon being
stored beneath the North Atlantic subtropical gyre at 1 km depth
(Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1). In summary, the net air-sea fluxes of
anthropogenic CO~2~ and heat depend on large-scale circulation, which is
associated with upper ocean stratification, mixed-layer depth, and
water-mass formation, transport and mixing (Sections 9.1–9.3).

*Changes in ocean processes and impact on the ocean carbon-heat nexus*

Future projections of the ocean carbon-heat nexus in the second half of
the 21st century, particularly those under weak or no mitigation
scenarios, are characterized by the strengthening of the two largest
positive feedbacks: weakening surface ocean CO~2~ buffering capacity
(increasing Revelle Factor) and warming that further reduces CO~2~
solubility and strengthens ocean stratification, which reduces exchange
between the ocean surface and interior (Jiang et al., 2019; Bronselaer
and Zanna, 2020). These are offset by a growing but scenario-dependent
negative feedback from increasing carbon and heat air sea fluxes towards
the ocean, due to increased atmospheric temperature and CO2
concentrations (Talley et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; McKinley et
al., 2020). The Southern Ocean in particular is one of the regions where
the projected feedback can be largest and where inter-model differences
are strongest (Roy et al., 2011; Frölicher et al., 2015; Hewitt et al.,
2016; Mongwe et al., 2018). These projected trends in ocean carbonate
chemistry (Section 5.4.2), together with surface ocean warming (Section
9.2.1.1), explain the slow down and long-term reduction of the ocean
sink for anthropogenic CO~2~ even as emissions continue to rise beyond
2050 under weak-to-no-mitigation scenarios (Figures 2.7.1 and 5.25, and
Technical Summary TS Box 7). Projected change in the North Atlantic and
Southern Ocean overturning circulation also impact air-sea fluxes of
heat and carbon. The *very likely* decline in AMOC in the 21st century
for all shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) scenarios (Section 9.2.3.1)
tends to reduce heat and carbon uptake, translating in a positive
feedback. In contrast, in the Southern Ocean, the future 21st century
projected increase in upper ocean overturning circulation (*low
confidence*) due to increasing wind forcing projected for all scenarios,
except those with large mitigation (SSP1-2.6), translate in a negative
feedback with increasing heat and carbon uptake and storage despite the
increasing stratification and outgassing of natural CO~2~ in the
upwelling zone (Sections 9.2.3.2 and 5.2.1.3).

In summary, a combination of unique chemical properties of seawater
carbonate combined with shared physical ocean processes explain the
coherence and scaling in the uptake and storage of both CO~2~ and heat
in the ocean, which is the basis for the carbon-heat nexus (*high
confidence*). In this way, the processes of the ocean carbon-heat nexus
help understand the quasi-linear and path independence of properties of
TCRE, which forms the basis for the zero emissions commitment (ZEC;
Section 5.5) (*medium confidence*). Future projections under low or no
mitigation indicate with *high confidence* that carbon chemistry and
warming will strengthen the positive feedback to climate change by
reducing ocean carbon uptake, and *medium confidence* that ocean
circulation may partially compensate that positive feedback by slightly
increasing anthropogenic carbon storage. Increasing ocean warming and
stratification may decrease exchanges between the surface and subsurface
ocean, which could reduce the path independence of TCRE, though this
effect can be partially counterbalanced regionally by increasing
circulation associated with increasing winds (*low confidence*).

    .anchor}Assessment of Limits of the TCRE Concept

##### Sensitivity to amount of cumulative CO~2~ emissions  {#sensitivity-to-amount-of-cumulative-co2-emissions .AR6Chap5Level451111}

The AR5 indicated that the concept of a constant ratio of cumulative
emissions of CO~2~ to temperature was applicable to scenarios with
increasing cumulative CO~2~ emissions up to 2000 PgC (M. Collins et al.,
2013). Recent analyses added confidence to this insight (Herrington and
Zickfeld, 2014; Steinacher and Joos, 2016) and also showed some evidence
of a potentially larger window of constant TCRE (Leduc et al., 2015;
Tokarska et al., 2016). Using an analytical approach, MacDougall and
Friedlingstein (2015) quantified a window of constant TCRE – defined as
the range in cumulative emissions over which the TCRE remains within 95%
of its maximum value – as between 360 to 1560 PgC. However, models with
a more sophisticated ocean representation suggest that TCRE could also
remain constant for considerably larger quantities of cumulative
emissions, up to at least 3000 PgC (Leduc et al., 2015; Tokarska et al.,
2016). Beyond this upper limit, studies are inconclusive, with some
suggesting that TCRE will decrease (Leduc et al., 2015) and others
indicating that the linearity would hold up to as much as 5000 PgC
(Tokarska et al., 2016).

As cumulative emissions increase, weakening land and ocean carbon sinks
increase the airborne fraction of CO~2~ emissions (see Figure 5.25), but
each unit increase in atmospheric CO~2~ has a smaller effect on global
temperature owing to the logarithmic relationship between CO~2~ and its
radiative forcing (Matthews et al., 2009; Etminan et al., 2016). At high
values of cumulative emissions, some models simulate less warming per
unit CO~2~ emitted, suggesting that the saturation of CO~2~ radiative
forcing becomes more important than the effect of weakened carbon sinks
(Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015). The behaviour of
carbon sinks at high emission levels remains uncertain, as models used
to assess the limits of the TCRE show a large spread in net land carbon
balance (Section 5.4.5), and most estimates did not include the effect
of permafrost carbon feedbacks (Sections 5.5.1.2.3 and 5.4). The latter
would tend to further increase the airborne fraction at high cumulative
emission levels, and could therefore extend the window of linearity to
higher total amounts of emissions (MacDougall et al., 2015). Leduc et
al. (2016) suggested further that a declining strength of snow and sea
ice feedbacks in a warmer world would also contribute to a smaller TCRE
at high amounts of cumulative emissions. However, Tokarska et al. (2016)
suggested that a large decrease in TCRE for high cumulative emissions is
only associated with some EMICs; in the four ESMs analysed in their
study, the TCRE remained approximately constant up to 5000 PgC, owing to
stronger declines in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake in ESMs
compared to EMICs.

Overall, there is *high agreement* between multiple lines of evidence
(*robust evidence*) resulting in *high confidence* that TCRE remains
constant for the domain of increasing cumulative CO~2~ emissions until
at least 1500 PgC, with *medium confidence* of it remaining constant up
to 3000 PgC because of less agreement across available lines of
evidence.

##### Sensitivity to the rate of CO~2~ emissions {#sensitivity-to-the-rate-of-co2-emissions .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Global average temperature increase responds over a time scale of about
10 years following the emission of a 100 PgC pulse of CO~2~ (Joos et
al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014), with larger emission pulses
associated with longer time scales and smaller pulses with shorter ones
(Joos et al., 2013; Matthews and Solomon, 2013; Zickfeld and Herrington,
2015). This behaviour is confirmed in other studies, including those
that calculate the temperature response to an instantaneous doubling or
quadrupling of atmospheric CO~2~ (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al.,
2013; Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015; Hajima et al.,
2020b). These findings suggest that the TCRE is sensitive to the rate of
emissions, but studies assessing this sensitivity have found diverging
results. For example, an increase in TCRE and its surrounding
uncertainty was reported for experiments that imply a gradual decline in
annual CO~2~ emissions (Tachiiri et al., 2019). These studies suggest
that, in most cases, TCRE would be expected to increase in scenarios
with decreasing annual emissions rates. This increase in TCRE for annual
CO~2~ emissions declining towards zero can be the result of the zero
emissions commitment (ZEC) which is the amount of warming projected to
occur following a complete cessation of emissions (see Section 4.7.2 for
its assessment), as well as Earth system processes that are
unrepresented in current TCRE estimates (Section 5.5.2.2.4) and other
factors. When using TCRE to estimate CO~2~ emissions consistent with a
specific maximum warming level, these factors have to be taken into
account (see Figure 5.31). Combined with recent literature on the ZEC
(MacDougall et al., 2020) and emissions pathways (Huppmann et al., 2018)
and noting the lack of literature that disentangles these various
contributions, there is *medium evidence* and *high agreement* resulting
in *medium confidence* that the TCRE remains a good predictor of
CO~2~-induced warming when applied in the context of emission reduction
pathways, provided that ZEC and long-term Earth system feedbacks are
adequately accounted for when emissions decline towards zero (see also
the next section).

##### Reversibility and Earth system feedbacks  {#reversibility-and-earth-system-feedbacks .AR6Chap5Level451111}

There are relatively few studies that have assessed how the TCRE is
expected to change in scenarios of declining emissions followed by net
negative annual CO~2~ emissions. Conceptually, the literature suggests
that the small lag of about a decade between CO~2~ emissions and
temperature change (Ricke and Caldeira, 2014; Zickfeld and Herrington,
2015) would result in more warming at a given amount of cumulative
emissions in a scenario where that emissions level is first exceeded and
then returned to by deploying negative emissions (referred to as an
‘overshoot’, as is often the case in scenarios that aim to limit
radiative forcing in 2100 to 2.6 or 1.9 W m^–2^ (Riahi et al., 2017;
Rogelj et al., 2018a). Zickfeld et al. (2016) showed this to hold across
a range of scenarios, with positive emissions followed by negative
emissions, whereby the TCRE increased by about 10% across the transition
from positive to negative emissions as a result of the thermal and
carbon inertia of the deep ocean. However, CMIP6 results for the
SSP5-3.4-overshoot scenario show diverging trends across various ESMs
(Figure 5.30). In an idealized CO~2~-concentration-driven setting,
Tachiiri et al. (2019) also reported an increase in TCRE. Exploring
pathways with emissions rates and overshoots closer to mitigation
pathways considered over the 21st century (in this case up to about 300
PgC), a recent emission-driven EMIC experiment showed pathway
independence of TCRE (Tokarska et al., 2019a). Furthermore, also in
absence of net negative emissions, warming would not necessarily remain
perfectly constant on time scales of centuries and millennia, but could
decrease or increase (Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; R.G. Williams et al.,
2017a; Hajima et al., 2020b). These additional changes in global mean
temperature increase at various time scales are known as the ZEC (Jones
et al., 2019; MacDougall et al., 2020), assessed in Section 4.7.2, and
have to be integrated when using TCRE to estimate warming or remaining
carbon budgets in overshoot scenarios.

The AR5-assessed (W.J. Collins et al., 2013) TCRE range was based in
part on the ESMs available at the time, which did not include some
potentially important Earth system feedbacks. Since then, a number of
studies have assessed the importance of permafrost carbon feedbacks, in
particular on remaining carbon budgets (MacDougall and Friedlingstein,
2015; MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017b; Gasser et al., 2018;
Lowe and Bernie, 2018), a development highlighted and assessed in the
IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2018b).
MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) reported a TCRE increase of about
15% when including permafrost carbon feedbacks. The overall linearity of
the TCRE during the 21st century was not affected, but they also found
that permafrost carbon feedbacks caused an increase in TCRE on
multi-century time scales under declining CO~2~ emission rates. Other
processes that are not regarded, or are only partially considered in
individual or all ESMs could cause a further increase or decrease of
TCRE (Matthews et al., 2020). These are discussed in detail in Section
5.4, but their quantitative effects on TCRE have not yet been explored
by the literature.

Whether TCRE remains an accurate predictor of CO~2~-induced warming when
annual CO~2~ emissions reach zero and are followed by net carbon dioxide
removal (also referred to as TCRE reversibility) therefore hinges on
contributions of slow components of the climate system that cause
unrealized warming from past CO~2~ emissions. Such slow components can
arise from either physical climate (i.e., ocean heat uptake) or carbon
cycle (i.e., ocean carbon uptake and permafrost carbon release)
processes. The combined effect of these processes determines the
magnitude and sign of the ZEC (MacDougall et al., 2020), which in turn
impacts TCRE reversibility. As discussed in Section 4.7.2, recent model
estimates of the ZEC suggest a range of ±0.19°C centred on zero
(MacDougall et al., 2020). This suggests *limited agreement* among
models as to the reversibility of the TCRE in response to net-negative
CO~2~ emissions. Furthermore, most models used for ZEC assessments to
date do not represent permafrost carbon processes, although
understanding their contribution is essential to isolate the TCRE
contribution. There is therefore *limited evidence* that quantifies the
impact of permafrost carbon feedbacks on the reversibility of TCRE,
leading to *low confidence* that the TCRE remains an accurate predictor
of temperature changes in scenarios of net-negative CO~2~ emissions on
time scales of more than a half a century.

    .anchor}Estimates of TCRE

The AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013) assessed that the TCRE is *likely* to
fall in the range of 0.8°C –2.5°C per 1000 PgC (or per exagrams of
carbon, EgC^–1^) for cumulative emissions up to 2000 PgC, based on
multiple lines of evidence. These include estimates based on ESMs of
varying complexity (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013;
Zickfeld et al., 2013), simple climate modelling approaches (Allen et
al., 2009; Rogelj et al., 2012) or observational constraints and
attributable warming (Gillett et al., 2013).

Since AR5, new studies have further expanded the evidence base for
estimating the value of TCRE. These studies rely on ESMs or EMICs,
observational constraints and concepts of attributable warming, or
theoretically derived equations (see Table 5.7 for an overview). Several
studies have endeavoured to partition the uncertainty in the value of
TCRE into constituent sources. For example, TCRE can be decomposed into
terms of TCR and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions
over time (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009). These two terms
are assessed individually (see Section 5.4 and Chapter 7, respectively)
and allow the integration of evidence assessed elsewhere in the report
into the assessment of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.4). Further studies use a
variety of methods, including analysing the outputs from CMIP5 (R.G.
Williams et al., 2017b) or CMIP6 (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and
Friedlingstein, 2020), conducting perturbed parameter experiments with a
single model (MacDougall et al., 2017), Monte-Carlo methods applied to a
simple climate model (Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), or observations
and estimates of the contribution of CO~2~ and non-CO~2~ forcers
(Matthews et al., 2021). All of the studies agree that uncertainty in
climate sensitivity – either equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) or
transient climate response (TCR) – is among the most important
contribution to uncertainty in TCRE, with uncertainty in the strength of
the land carbon feedback and ocean heat uptake or ventilation having
also been identified as crucial to uncertainty in TCRE []{#_Hlk74847026

Katavouta et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein,
2020; Spafford and Macdougall, 2020). Finally, internal variability has
been shown to affect the maximum accuracy of TCRE estimates by ±0.1°C
per 1000 PgC (5–95% range; (Tokarska et al., 2020).

    .anchor}Combined Assessment of TCRE

Studies differ in how they define TCRE, in the methods they use, and
their assumptions, such as the assumed climate sensitivity distribution
or the choice of metrics of global temperature change (e.g. GMST or
GSAT, see Table 5.7). This makes TCRE estimates from individual studies
difficult to compare. The combined assessment of TCRE therefore takes
advantage of the well-established decomposition of TCRE in two factors:
the TCR and the AF (Section 5.5.1.3). This provides a TCRE assessment
range for CO~2~-induced warming at the time of doubling CO~2~
concentrations that builds on the broader Working Group 1 assessment.
Expert judgement based on the airborne fraction range found in CMIP6
models (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) suggest a
value of 53% with a 1-sigma range of ±6%, which is double the sigma
range based on the spread of CMIP6 models only. Combining this range
with the AR6 TCR assessment (Section 7.5, best estimate 1.8°C,
1.4°C–2.2°C *likely* and 1.2°C–2.4°C *very likely* range) results in a
5–95% range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC. Based on expert judgement that
accounts for the incomplete coverage of all Earth system components,
this results in a consolidated assessment that TCRE would fall *likely*
in the range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC, with a best estimate of 1.65°C
per 1000 PgC. Warming here reflects the human-induced GSAT increase and
assumes a normal distribution. Some studies using observational
constraints support a lognormal shape for the TCRE distribution
(Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), but such a distribution is currently
not supported by the combined assessment of TCR and airborne fraction.
Finally, this assessed TCRE range needs to be considered in combination
with the ZEC (Section 4.7.2) when estimating the CO~2~-induced warming
of low-emissions scenarios.

###  Remaining Carbon Budget Assessment {#remaining-carbon-budget-assessment .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Estimates of remaining carbon budgets consistent with holding global
warming below a specific temperature threshold depend on a range of
issues, which are increasingly being studied and quantified. These
issues include: (i) well-understood methodological and definitional
choices (Sections 5.5.2.1 and 5.5.2.2; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a;
Rogelj et al., 2016, 2018b); and (ii) a set of contributing factors such
as historical warming, the TCRE and its limitations, the ZEC (the amount
of warming projected to occur following a complete cessation of
emissions; see Section 4.7.2), as well as contributions of non-CO~2~
climate forcers (Section 5.5.2.2; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015;
Rogelj et al., 2015a, b; MacDougall, 2016; Simmons and Matthews, 2016;
Ehlert et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2017, 2021; Millar et al., 2017b;
Goodwin et al., 2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018;
Tokarska et al., 2018; Cain et al., 2019). These contributing factors
are integrated in an overarching assessment of remaining carbon budgets
for limiting global average warming to levels ranging from 1.5°C to
2.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels provided in Section 5.5.2.3. Box
5.2 provides an overview of the methodological advances since AR5 (W.J.
Collins et al., 2013).

    .anchor}Framework and Earlier Approaches

The AR6 Glossary (Annex VII) defines remaining carbon budgets as the
maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions
expressed from a recent specified date that would result in limiting
global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into
account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers, consistent
with their assessment in the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Studies,
however, apply a variety of definitions that result in published
remaining carbon budget estimates informing to cumulative emissions at
the time when global-mean temperature increase would reach, exceed,
avoid, or peak at a given warming level with a given probability (M.
Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014;
Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; IPCC, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2016; Millar et
al., 2017b ).

This section provides an assessment of remaining carbon budgets
consistent with the AR6 Glossary definition (Annex VII). Given that some
feedbacks are time dependent, the values in this section apply to
limiting warming over the 21st century, consistent with recent studies
highlighting the usefulness of time-limited carbon budgets (Sanderson,
2020). Irrespective of the exact definition of the remaining carbon
budget, the finding that higher cumulative CO~2~ emissions lead to
higher temperatures implies that annual net CO~2~ emissions have to
decline to close to zero in order to halt global warming, whether at
1.5°C, 2°C or another level (Allen et al., 2018).

Two approaches were used in AR5 to determine carbon budgets (M. Collins
et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; IPCC,
2014; Rogelj et al., 2016). Working Group I (WGI) reported threshold
exceedance budgets (TEB) that correspond to the amount of cumulative
CO~2~ emissions at the time a specific temperature threshold is
exceeded, with a given probability in a particular greenhouse-gas and
aerosol (pre-cursor) emission scenario (M. Collins et al., 2013; IPCC,
2013b; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013). WGI also reported TEBs for the
hypothetical case that only CO~2~ would be emitted by human activities
(M. Collins et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013b; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013). The
AR5 Working Group III used threshold avoidance budgets (TAB) that
correspond to the cumulative CO~2~ emissions over a given time period of
a subset of greenhouse-gas and aerosol (precursor) emission scenarios in
which global-mean temperature increase stays below a specific
temperature threshold with at least a given probability (Clarke et al.,
2014). The AR5 synthesis report used TABs defined until the time of peak
warming over the 21st century (IPCC, 2014). Drawbacks have been
identified for TEBs and TABs (Rogelj et al., 2016). TABs provide an
estimate of the cumulative CO~2~ emissions under pathways that commonly
do not exceed a specific global warming threshold. However, the actual
level of maximum warming can vary between pathways, leading to an
unnecessary and poorly constrained spread in TAB estimates (Rogelj et
al., 2016). Therefore, the TAB approach typically does not result in
accurate projections of the remaining carbon budget. One drawback of
TEBs is that they provide an estimate of the cumulative CO~2~ emissions
at the time global warming crosses a given threshold of interest in a
specific emissions scenario – for example, most of the standard
scenarios used in climate change research, such as the RCPs or SSP-based
scenarios exceed global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C (see Cross-Chapter Box
1.5) (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Friedlingstein
et al., 2014a; Millar et al., 2017b). Because of potential variations in
non-CO~2~ warming at that point in time, or potential lags of about a
decade in CO~2~ warming (Joos et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014;
Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016, 2018b; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015) TEBs
also do not provide a precise estimate of the remaining carbon budget
for limiting warming to a specific level.

Since the publication of AR5 (W.J. Collins et al., 2013), several new
approaches have been proposed that provide a solution to the identified
limitations of TABs and TEBs. Most of these approaches indirectly rely
on the concept of TCRE (Section 5.5.1), for example, because they
estimate modelled cumulative CO~2~ emissions until a temperature
threshold is crossed and use this budget to infer insights for pathways
that attempt to limit warming to below this threshold and thus need to
follow a different path (Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Matthews et al.,
2017; Millar et al., 2017b; Goodwin et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett,
2018). In this report, the assessment framework of IPCC SR1.5 for
remaining carbon budgets is applied (Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). This
framework allows integration of multiple lines of evidence to assess the
contributions of five components that together result in a consolidated
assessment of the remaining carbon budget (TCRE, historical warming,
non-CO~2~ warming, the ZEC, and adjustments due to additional Earth
system feedbacks, see Section 5.5.2.2). It builds on the advances in
estimating remaining carbon budgets or related quantities that have been
published since AR5 (Rogelj et al., 2015a; Haustein et al., 2017;
Matthews et al., 2017, 2021; Millar et al., 2017b; Gasser et al., 2018;
Lowe and Bernie, 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Nicholls et al., 2020).

Recent studies suggest further changes to this framework by including
non-linear adjustments to the TCRE contribution (Nicholls et al., 2020),
or including non-CO~2~ forcers in different ways by accounting for their
different forcing effects (Matthews et al., 2021). Figure 5.31 provides
a conceptual schematic of how the various individually assessed
contributions are combined into a consolidated assessment of the
remaining carbon budget. Together with estimates of historical CO~2~
emissions to date (Section 5.2.1), these remaining carbon budgets
provide the overall amount of cumulative CO~2~ emissions consistent with
limiting global warming to specific levels. A comparison with the
approach applied in AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014)
is available in IPCC SR1.5 Section 2.2.2 (Rogelj et al., 2018b) as well
as Box 5.2.

    .anchor}Assessment of Individual Components

Remaining carbon budgets are assessed through the combination of five
separate components (Forster et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b). Each
component is discussed and assessed separately in the sections below,
based on all available lines of evidence. Box 5.1 details the
differences compared to AR5 and SR1.5 estimates[]{#_Hlk74848504 .anchor}
(W.J. Collins et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2018b).

##### TCRE  {#tcre .AR6Chap5Level451111}

The first and central component for estimating remaining carbon budgets
is the TCRE. Based on the assessment in Section 5.5.1.4, an assessed
*likely* range for TCRE of 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 PgC with a normal
distribution is used.

##### Historical warming {#historical-warming .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Advances in methods to estimate remaining carbon budgets have shown the
importance of applying an estimate of historical warming to date that is
as accurate as possible (Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska and Gillett,
2018). This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining
carbon budgets for global warming levels that are relatively close to
present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al.,
2018b). Also shown to be important is the definition of global average
temperature by which historical warming is estimated ( Cross-Chapter Box
2.3; Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018;
Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019b), as is the correct
isolation of human-induced global warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Allen
et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability. Based on the
assessment in Section 3.3 (Table 3.1), here we apply a historical
warming best-estimate expressed in a GSAT of 1.07°C (0.8–1.3°C, *likely*
range) between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019. This choice implies global
coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were reported
in GSAT (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013), the SR1.5
where GSAT was the central metric for remaining carbon budgets (Rogelj
et al., 2018b), and recent studies that highlight how GSAT enables an
easy translation with AR5 (Tokarska et al., 2019b). The use of other
historical reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) or temperature
metrics and updated data products (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) can result in
a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining
carbon budget.

##### Non-CO~2~ warming contribution  {#non-co2-warming-contribution .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Non-CO~2~ emissions contribute either cumulatively (N~2~O, and other
long-lived climate forcers) or in proportion to their annual emissions
(CH~4~ and other short-lived climate forcers) to global warming, and
thus also affect estimates of remaining carbon budgets by reducing the
amount of warming that could still result from CO~2~ emissions
[]{#_Hlk74850189 .anchor}(Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et
al., 2014a; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016; R.G.
Williams et al., 2016, 2017b; Matthews et al., 2017; Collins et al.,
2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Zickfeld et al.,
2021). The size of this contribution has been estimated both implicitly
(Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al.,
2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018)
and explicitly (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2018b; Collins et al., 2018;
Matthews et al., 2021) by varying the assumptions of non-CO~2~ emissions
and associated warming. Internally consistent evolutions of future CO~2~
and non-CO~2~ emissions allow for derivation of non-CO~2~ warming
contributions consistent with global CO~2~ emissions reaching net zero
levels, and therewith capping maximum future CO~2~ emissions (Smith and
Mizrahi, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et
al., 2018b; Matthews et al., 2021). Pathways that reflect such
development typically show a stabilization or decline in non-CO~2~
radiative forcing and warming at, and after the time of, global CO~2~
emissions reaching net zero levels, as illustrated in the scenario
database underlying IPCC's SR1.5 (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al.,
2018b).

The impact of non-CO~2~ emissions on remaining carbon budgets is
assessed with emulators (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Millar et al., 2017b;
Gasser et al., 2018; Goodwin et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; C.J.
Smith et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2021) that incorporate synthesized
climate and carbon-cycle knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The
estimated implied non-CO~2~ warming can subsequently be applied to
reduce the remaining allowable warming for estimating the remaining
carbon budget (Figure 5.31; Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). Alternative
methods estimate the non-CO~2~ fraction of total anthropogenic forcing
(Matthews et al., 2021), or do not correct for non-CO~2~ warming
directly. The latter methods instead consider CO~2~ and non-CO~2~
warming together to define a CO~2~-forcing equivalent carbon budget from
which eventual non-CO~2~ contributions expressed in
CO~2~-forcing-equivalent emissions have to be subtracted to obtain a
remaining carbon budget (Jenkins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2020).
These studies also use emulators to invert a specified evolution of
non-CO~2~ forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO~2~
emissions (Matthews et al., 2020), or alternatively use empirical
relationships linking changes in non-CO~2~ greenhouse gas emissions to
warming (Cain et al., 2019). Methods to express non-CO~2~ emissions in
CO~2~ equivalence are assessed in Section 7.6, yet their applicability
and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been
covered in-depth in the literature.

Application of the SR1.5 method (Forster et al., 2018; Rogelj et al.,
2018b) with AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1) suggests a median
additional non-CO~2~ warming contribution at the time global CO~2~
emissions reach net zero levels of about 0.1°C–0.2°C relative to
2010–2019. Uncertainty surrounding this range due to geophysical
uncertainties such as non-CO~2~-forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the
order of ±0.1°C. Differences in the choices of mitigation strategies
considered in low-emission scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018) result in a
potential additional variation around the central range of at least
±0.1°C (spread across scenarios, referred to as non-CO~2~ scenario
uncertainty in Table 5.8).

##### Adjustments due to the zero emissions commitment  {#adjustments-due-to-the-zero-emissions-commitment .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Use of TCRE for estimating remaining carbon budgets needs to consider
the zero emissions commitment (ZEC), the potential additional warming
after a complete cessation of net CO~2~ emissions. Based on the ZEC
assessment presented in Section 4.7.2, the ZEC’s central value is taken
to be zero with a *likely* range of ±0.19°C, noting that it might either
increase or decrease after half a century. ZEC uncertainty is assessed
for a time frame of half a century, as this most appropriately reflects
the time between stringent mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO~2~
emissions and the end of the century. For shorter time horizons, a
similar central zero value applies, but with a smaller range (MacDougall
et al., 2020). Experiments that ramped up and down emissions following a
bell-shaped trajectory (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016a) show that when
annual CO~2~ emissions decline to zero at a pace consistent with those
currently assumed in mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj
et al., 2018b), the ZEC will already be realized to a large degree at
the time of reaching net zero CO~2~ emissions (MacDougall et al., 2020).

##### Adjustments for additional Earth system feedbacks  {#adjustments-for-additional-earth-system-feedbacks .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Section 5.5.1.2 highlighted recent literature describing potential
impacts of Earth system feedbacks that have typically not been included
in standard ESMs (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Schneider von
Deimling et al., 2015; Schädel et al., 2016; Burke et al., 2017b;
Mahowald et al., 2017; Comyn-Platt et al., 2018; Gasser et al., 2018;
Lowe and Bernie, 2018), the most important of which is carbon release
from thawing permafrost. The IPCC SR1.5 estimated unrepresented Earth
system processes to result in a reduction of remaining carbon budgets of
up to 100 GtCO~2~ over the course of this century, and more thereafter
(Rogelj et al., 2018b). Here this assessment is updated based on the
Earth system feedback assessment of Section 5.4.8 and synthesized in
Figure 5.29 by applying the reverse method by Gregory et al. (2009).

The assessment in Section 5.4 and Box 5.1 highlights the different
nature, magnitude and uncertainties surrounding additional Earth system
feedback. The remaining carbon budgets reported in Table 5.8 account for
these feedbacks, including corrections due to permafrost CO~2~ and CH~4~
feedbacks as well as those due to aerosol and atmospheric chemistry
(Section 5.4.8). Two of these additional feedbacks (tropospheric ozone
and methane lifetime feedbacks) are included in the projections of
non-CO~2~ warming carried out with AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1).
The remainder of these independent Earth system feedbacks combine to a
feedback of about 7 ± 27 PgC K^–1^ (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO~2~
°C^–1^). Overall, Section 5.4.8 assessed there to be *low confidence* in
the exact magnitude of these feedbacks and they represent identified
additional amplifying factors that scale with additional warming, and
mostly increase the challenge of limiting global warming to or below
specific temperature levels.

    .anchor}Remaining Carbon Budget

The combination of the five components assessed in Sections
5.5.2.2.1–5.5.2.2.5 allows for an overall assessment of the remaining
carbon budget in line with different levels of global average warming,
as documented in IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). The overall
assessment of remaining carbon budgets (Table 5.8) reflects the
uncertainty in TCRE quantification and provides estimates of the
uncertainties surrounding the contributions of each of the respective
further components. A formal combination of all uncertainties is not
possible because they are not all independent, or because they represent
choices rather than probabilistic uncertainties (Matthews et al., 2021).
In light of all uncertainties related to TCRE, non-CO~2~ forcing and
response, the level of non-CO~2~ mitigation, and historical warming,
there is a small probability that the remaining carbon budget for
limiting warming to 1.5°C since the 1850–1900 period is effectively
zero. However, applying best estimate values for all but uncertainties
in Earth system feedbacks and TCRE, the remaining carbon budgets in line
with the Paris Agreement are generally small yet not zero (see Table
5.8).

There is *robust evidence* supporting the concept of TCRE as well as
*high confidence* in the range of historical human-induced warming.
Combined with the assessed uncertainties in the Earth system’s response
to non-CO~2~ emissions and less well-established quantification of some
of the effect of non-linear Earth system feedbacks, this leads to
*medium confidence* being assigned to the assessed remaining carbon
budget estimates while noting the identified and assessed uncertainties
and potential variations. The reported values are applicable to warming
and cumulative emissions over the 21st century. For climate
stabilization beyond the 21st century, this confidence would decline to
*very low confidence* due to uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and
the ZEC.

For estimates of total carbon budgets in line with limiting global
warming to a specific level, an estimate of historical CO~2~ emissions
should be added to the remaining carbon budget values reported in Table
5.8. Historical CO~2~ emissions between 1850 and 2019 have been
estimated at about 655 ± 65 PgC (1-sigma range, or 2390 ± 240 GtCO~2~,
see Table 5.1), while since 1 January 2015, an additional 57 PgC (210
GtCO~2~) has been emitted until the end of 2019 (Friedlingstein et al.,
2020).

Implications of Methodological Advancements in Estimating the Remaining Carbon Budget since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) {#implications-of-methodological-advancements-in-estimating-the-remaining-carbon-budget-since-the-ipccs-fifth-assessment-report-ar5 .AR6Chap5Box}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methodological advancements since AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013; IPCC,
2013b, 2014; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014) result in
an updated and strengthened assessment of remaining carbon budgets.
Methods and approaches at the time of AR5 are described in Section
5.5.2.1. Since AR5, strengths and weaknesses of various approaches have
been more clearly articulated in the literature (e.g., in Rogelj et al.,
2016; Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018; Matthews et al.,
2020), resulting in a new consolidated framework applied in SR1.5
(Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019) that is also used in AR6. This framework
incorporates five methodological advancements compared to AR5, the
implications of which are discussed in this box.

First, publications since AR5 applied methods that limit the effect of
uncertainties in historical, diagnosed emissions in coupled Earth system
models on estimates of the remaining carbon budget (Millar et al.,
2017b; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). These new methods express remaining
carbon budget estimates relative to a recent reference period instead of
relative to the pre-industrial period (Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska et
al., 2019b). Estimates of the full carbon budget since the
pre-industrial period can still be obtained by adding estimates of
historical CO~2~ emissions (Table 5.1) to the estimates in Table 5.8.
This methodological update resulted, all other aspects being equal, in
median estimates of remaining carbon budgets being about 350–450 GtCO~2~
larger compared to AR5 (IPCC, 2014; Millar et al., 2017b).

At the time of AR5, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5; Taylor et al., 2012) provided global surface air temperature
(GSAT) projections for the representative concentration pathways
(Meinshausen et al., 2011c), which were used to determine carbon budgets
while taking into account the effects of non-CO~2~ forcers (T.F. Stocker
et al., 2013). Their use came with two recognized limitations: first,
the model spread of the CMIP5 represents an ensemble of opportunity with
limited statistical value (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007); and second, the
evolution of non-CO~2~ emissions as a function of cumulative CO~2~
emissions can differ markedly between high and low emissions pathways
(Meinshausen et al., 2011c; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al.,
2016; Matthews et al., 2017). Solutions to these two limitations have
been published since AR5 and represent the second and third
methodological improvement compared to AR5.

The reliance on an ensemble of opportunity (i.e., a serendipitous
collection of scenario data from a variety of sources and studies) is
avoided by methodologically separating the assessment of future warming
contributions of non-CO~2~ emissions from the spread in transient
climate response to cumulative CO~2~ emissions (TCRE; Section 5.5.2;
Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019. This facilitates the explicit representation
of TCRE uncertainty by a formal distribution, in this case a normal
distribution with a 1.0–2.3°C PgC^–1^ 1–sigma range (Section 5.5.1.4).
The effect of this methodological advance can be estimated from a direct
comparison of the frequency distribution of TCRE in CMIP5 models that
were used in AR5, and the formal TCRE distribution used in AR6, but is
limited in precision. For estimates of the remaining carbon budget in
line with limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C relative to pre-industrial
levels, this improvement is estimated to lead to a reduction of budgets
of the order of about 100 GtCO~2~ between AR5 and AR6.

The third methodological improvement is a more direct estimation of the
warming contribution of non-CO~2~ emissions, consistent with pathways
that bring global CO~2~ emissions down to net zero. Instead of deriving
this contribution implicitly from the CMIP5 ensemble, climate emulators
(Meinshausen et al., 2011b; Schwarber et al., 2018; C.J. Smith et al.,
2018) that are calibrated to the combined AR6 assessment (Cross-Chapter
Box 7.1) are used to estimate the non-CO~2~ contribution across a wide
variety of stringent mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018). The
specific relative effect of this advance compared to AR5 is not
calculable because CMIP5 data does not isolate non-CO~2~ from
CO~2~-induced warming.

The fourth and fifth methodological advancements are to explicitly
account for the zero emissions commitment (ZEC; Section 5.5.2.2.4) and
adjust estimates for Earth system feedbacks that are typically not
represented in Earth system models (ESMs; Section 5.5.2.2.5). The
central estimate of the assessed ZEC used in SR1.5 and AR6 is zero
(Sections 4.7.2). ZEC uncertainties are reported separately (Table 5.8),
and the additional consideration of ZEC therefore does result in a
better understanding but not in a net shift of central estimates of the
remaining carbon budget compared to AR5. Furthermore, AR5 did not
explicitly account for Earth system feedbacks not represented in ESMs.
SR1.5 assessed that they could reduce the remaining carbon budgets by
about 100 GtCO~2~ over centennial time scales. This assessment has been
updated in AR6, including a wider range of biogeochemical feedbacks and
new evidence (Section 5.5.2.2.5). Some of these feedbacks are captured
in the estimation of non-CO~2~ warming (see below), while the combined
effect of remaining positive and negative feedbacks is assessed to
reduce the remaining carbon budget estimates by 7 ± 27 PgC K^–1^
(1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO~2~ °C^–1^) compared to AR5.

Between SR1.5 and AR6, each of the five components described in Section
5.5.2.1 and Figure 5.32 have been re-assessed (see Sections
5.5.2.2.1–5.5.2.2.5). Their updated assessments in turn affect the
assessment of the remaining carbon budget. The new and narrower
assessment of TCRE in AR6 compared to SR1.5 (*likely* range of
1.0°C–2.3°C EgC^–1^ compared to 0.8°C–2.5°C EgC^–1^, respectively, with
the same central estimate) leads to no change in median estimates and
about a 50 and 100 GtCO~2~ increase in remaining carbon budgets
estimates at the 67th percentile in AR6 compared to SR1.5 for 1.5°C and
2°C of global warming, respectively.

For historical warming, SR1.5 used GSAT increase between 1850–1900 and
2006–2015 of 0.97°C as its main starting point, while also providing
values for other temperature metrics. Remaining carbon budgets were
expressed starting from 1 January 2018 by accounting for historical
emissions emitted from 1 January 2011 until the end of 2017. AR6 uses
anthropogenic (human-induced) warming until the 2010–2019 period, which
is assessed at the 0.8-1.3°C range, with a best estimate of 1.07°C
(Table 3.1), and subsequently accounts for historical emissions from 1
January 2015 until the end of 2019 to express remaining carbon budget
estimates from 1 January 2020 onwards. The human-induced warming between
the 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 periods used in SR1.5 was assessed by AR6 at
0.97°C (Table 3.1). In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effect
of data and methodological updates in historical warming estimates thus
results in no shift in estimated remaining carbon budgets between SR1.5
and AR6. However, the emissions of the years passed since SR1.5 reduce
the remaining carbon budget by about 85 GtCO~2~. Note that AR6 also
updated its GSAT assessment for total warming between the 1850–1900 and
2006–2015 periods, reporting 0.94°C of warming. On a like-with-like
basis, this would have resulted in slightly larger remaining carbon
budgets compared to SR1.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).

The non-CO~2~ contribution to future warming in emissions scenarios
(Huppmann et al., 2018) is re-assessed with AR6-calibrated emulators, in
this case MAGICC7 (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1; Meinshausen et al., 2009,
2011a, 2020). The re-assessment of non-CO~2~ warming with MAGICC7
results in a relationship that closely matches the average relationship
applied in SR1.5 (shown in Section 2.SM.1.1.2 in Forster et al., 2018),
and therefore does not change estimates of the remaining carbon budget
relative to SR1.5. The median ZEC assessment remained the same between
SR1.5 and AR6, and therefore does not change the median remaining carbon
budget estimates. Finally, as indicated above, AR6 expanded the
assessment of Earth system feedbacks compared to SR1.5 and included it
in its central remaining carbon budget estimates. Some feedbacks are
accounted for through the non-CO~2~ warming estimate (Section
5.5.2.2.5), while the remainder combines to reduce the median remaining
carbon budget estimates for 1.5°C and 2°C of warming by about 10 to 20
GtCO~2~, respectively, compared to SR1.5.

All methodological improvements and new evidence combined result in
median and 67th percentile remaining carbon budget estimates for
limiting warming to 1.5°C being about 300–350 GtCO~2~ larger compared to
an assessment that would use the evidence and methods available at the
time of the AR5. For limiting warming to 2°C, the difference is about
400–500 GtCO~2~. Since SR1.5, fewer key advancements had to be
integrated. In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effects of all
AR6 updates result in median remaining carbon budget estimates for
limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C being the same and about 60 GtCO~2~
smaller, respectively, in AR6 compared to SR1.5. At the 67th percentile,
remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C
are about 40 to 60 GtCO~2~ larger, respectively, mainly as a result of a
narrower assessed TCRE range.

Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification {#biogeochemical-implications-of-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-solar-radiation-modification .AR6Chap5Level151}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction {#introduction-1 .AR6Chap5Level2511}

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to anthropogenic activities that
seek to remove CO~2~ from the atmosphere and durably store it in
geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products (Glossary).
CO~2~ is removed from the atmosphere by enhancing biological or
geochemical carbon sinks or by direct capture of CO~2~ from air and
storage. Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to the intentional,
planetary-scale modification of the Earth’s radiative budget with the
aim of limiting global warming. Most proposed SRM methods involve
reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching the surface,
but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical
thickness and cloud lifetime (Glossary). SRM does not fall within the
IPCC definitions of mitigation and adaptation (Glossary). CDR and SRM
are referred to as ‘geoengineering’ in some of the literature, and are
considered separately in this report.

This section assesses the implications of CDR and SRM for biogeochemical
cycles. CDR has received growing interest as an important mitigation
option in emission scenarios consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement
climate goals (SR1.5, SRCCL). The climate effects of CDR and SRM are
assessed in Chapter 4, and a detailed assessment of the socio-economic
dimensions of these options is presented in AR6 WGIII, Chapters 7 and
12.

### Biogeochemical Responses to Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) {#biogeochemical-responses-to-carbon-dioxide-removal-cdr .AR6Chap5Level2511}

The scope of this section is to assess the general and methods-specific
effects of CDR on the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical
cycles. The focus is on Earth system feedbacks that either amplify or
reduce carbon sequestration potentials of specific CDR methods, and
determine their effectiveness in reducing atmospheric CO~2~ and
mitigating climate change. Technical carbon sequestration potentials of
CDR methods are assessed on a qualitative scale; a comprehensive
quantitative assessment is left to the AR6 Working Group III Report
(Chapters 7 and 12). Biogeochemical and biophysical side effects of CDR
methods are assessed here, while the co-benefits and trade-offs for
biodiversity, water and food production are briefly discussed for
completeness, but a comprehensive assessment is left to WGII (Chapters 2
and 5) and WGIII (Chapters 7 and 12). The assessment in this chapter
emphasizes literature published since the AR5 WGI report (Chapter 6) for
the assessment of the global carbon cycle response to CDR, and
literature published since IPCC SR1.5 (Chapter 4; IPCC, 2018a), SRCCL
(Chapter 6, IPCC, 2019) and SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) for the
assessment of potentials and side effects of specific CDR methods.
Emerging literature on deliberate methane removal is also briefly
discussed.

In this chapter, CDR methods are categorised by the carbon cycle
processes that result in CO~2~ removal: (i) enhanced net biological
production and storage by land ecosystems; (ii) enhanced net biological
production and storage in the open and coastal ocean; (iii) enhanced
geochemical processes on land and in the ocean; and (iv) direct air
capture and storage by chemical processes. A subset of CDR methods that
restore or sustainably manage natural or modified ecosystems while
providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits are also referred
to as natural or nature-based solutions (Glossary; Griscom et al., 2017,
2020; Fargione et al., 2018). CDR methods commonly discussed in the
literature are summarized in Table 5.9. Other CDR options have been
suggested, but there is insufficient literature for an assessment. These
include ocean biomass burial, ocean downwelling, removal of CO~2~ from
seawater with storage, and cloud alkalinization (Keller et al., 2018a;
GESAMP, 2019).

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535741 .anchor}]{#_Toc33564325 .anchor}Global Carbon
    Cycle Responses to CDR

This subsection assesses evidence about the response of the global
carbon cycle to CDR from idealized model simulations which assume that
CO~2~ is removed from the atmosphere directly and stored permanently in
the geologic reservoir, which is analogous to direct air carbon capture
with carbon storage (DACCS) (Table 5.9). The carbon cycle response to
specific land and ocean-based CDR methods is assessed in Section
5.6.2.2.2. At the time of AR5 there were very few studies about the
global carbon cycle response to CDR. Based on these studies and general
understanding of the carbon cycle, AR5 WGI Chapter 6 assessed that it is
*virtually certain* that deliberate removal of CO~2~ from the atmosphere
will be partially offset by outgassing of CO~2~ from the ocean and land
carbon sinks. *Low confidence* was placed on any quantification of
effects. Since AR5 WGI Chapter 6, several studies have investigated the
carbon cycle response to CDR in idealized 'pulse' removal simulations,
whereby a specified amount of CO~2~ is removed instantly from the
atmosphere, and scenario simulations with CO~2~ emissions and removals
following a plausible trajectory. In addition, a dedicated carbon
dioxide removal model intercomparison project was initiated (CDRMIP;
Keller et al., 2018b) which includes a range of CDR experiments from
idealized simulations to simulations of deployment of specific CDR
methods (afforestation and ocean alkalinization).

This subsection assesses three aspects of the climate-carbon cycle
response to CDR: the time-dependent behaviour of CO~2~ fluxes in
scenarios with CDR, the effectiveness of CDR in drawing down atmospheric
CO~2~ and cooling global mean temperature, and the symmetry of the
climate-carbon cycle response to positive and negative CO~2~ emissions.

Carbon Cycle Response to CO~2~ Removal from the Atmosphere {#carbon-cycle-response-to-co2-removal-from-the-atmosphere .AR6Chap5Box}
----------------------------------------------------------

During the industrial era, CO~2~ emitted by the combustion of fossil
fuels and land-use change has been redistributed between atmosphere,
land, and ocean carbon reservoirs due to carbon cycle processes (Box
5.3, Figure 1b and Figure 5.13). Over the past decade (2010–2019), 46%
of the emitted CO~2~ remained in the atmosphere, 23% was taken up by the
ocean, and 31% by the terrestrial biosphere (Section 5.2.1.5). When
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is applied during periods in which human
activities are net CO~2~ sources to the atmosphere, and the amount of
emissions removed by CDR is smaller than the net source (net positive
CO~2~ emissions), CDR acts to reduce the net emissions (Box 5.3 Figure
1c). In this scenario, part of the CO~2~ emissions in the atmosphere are
removed by the land and ocean sinks, as has been the case historically.

When CDR removes more CO~2~ emissions than human activities emit (net
negative CO~2~ emissions), and atmospheric CO~2~ declines, the land and
ocean sinks initially continue to take up CO~2~ from the atmosphere.
This is because carbon sinks, particularly the ocean, exhibit inertia
and continue to respond to the prior trajectory of rising atmospheric
CO~2~ concentration. After some time, which is determined by the
magnitude of the removal and the rate and amount of CO~2~ emissions
prior to the CDR application, land and ocean carbon reservoirs begin to
release CO~2~ into the atmosphere, making CDR less effective (Box 5.3,
Figure 1d).

**\[START Box 5.3, Figure 1 HERE\]**

**Box 5.3, Figure 1: Schematic representation of carbon fluxes between
atmosphere, land, ocean and geological reservoirs.** Different system
conditions are shown: (a) an unperturbed Earth system; and changes in
carbon fluxes for (b) an Earth system perturbed by fossil fuel CO~2~
emissions, (c) an Earth system in which fossil fuel CO~2~ emissions are
partially offset by CDR, (d) an Earth system in which CDR exceeds CO~2~
emissions from fossil fuels ('net negative' CO~2~ emissions). Carbon
fluxes depicted in (a) (solid and dashed black lines) also occur in
(b)–(d). The question mark in the land-to-ocean carbon flux perturbation
in (c) and (d) indicates that the effect of CDR on this flux is unknown.
Note that box sizes do not scale with the size of carbon reservoirs.

##### Carbon cycle response to instantaneous CDR  {#carbon-cycle-response-to-instantaneous-cdr .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Idealized ‘pulse’ removal Earth system model simulations are useful for
understanding the carbon cycle response to CDR. Figure 5.32 illustrates
the response of atmospheric CO~2~, land and ocean carbon sinks to an
instantaneous CO~2~ removal applied from a pre-industrial equilibrium
state. Following CO~2~ removal from the atmosphere, the atmospheric
CO~2~ concentration declines rapidly at first and then rebounds (Figure
5.32a). This rebound is due to CO~2~ release by the terrestrial
biosphere and the ocean in response to declining atmospheric CO~2~
levels (Figure 5.32b,c; M. Collins et al., 2013). For the model
simulations shown in Figure 5.32, 23 ± 6% (mean ± 1 standard deviation)
of the 100 PgC removed remains out of the atmosphere 80–100 years after
the instantaneous removal. The remainder is offset by CO~2~ outgassing
from the land (49 ± 12%) and ocean (29 ± 7%). While the direction of the
CO~2~ flux is robust across models, the relative contribution of the
outgassing from land and ocean reservoirs to the atmospheric CO~2~
rebound after removal varies. These results corroborate the *high
confidence* placed by AR5 WGI (Chapter 6) on the partial compensation of
CO~2~ removal from the atmosphere by CO~2~ outgassing from the land and
ocean. Due to disagreement between models, the magnitude of this
outgassing and in the relative contribution of land and ocean fluxes
remains *low confidence*.

    concentration, (b) change in land carbon reservoir, (c) change in

    CMIP6 Earth system models and the UVic ESCM model of intermediate
    complexity forced with 100 PgC instantaneously removed from the
    atmosphere. The ‘pulse’ removal is applied from a model state in
    equilibrium with a pre-industrial atmospheric CO~2~ concentration
    (CDRMIP experiment CDR-pi-pulse; Keller et al., 2018b). Changes in
    land and ocean carbon reservoirs are calculated relative to a
    pre-industrial control simulation. Data for the UVic ESCM is from
    Zickfeld et al. (2021). Further details on data sources and
    processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

##### Carbon cycle response over time in scenarios with CDR  {#carbon-cycle-response-over-time-in-scenarios-with-cdr .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Since AR5 WGI (Chapter 6), studies with ESMs have explored the land and
ocean carbon sink response to scenarios with CO~2~ emissions gradually
declining during the 21st century. As CDR and other mitigation
activities are ramped up, CO~2~ emissions in these scenarios reach net
zero and, as removals exceed emissions, become net negative. Studies
exploring the carbon sink response to such scenarios (e.g. RCP2.6,
SSP1-2.6) show that, when net CO~2~ emissions are positive but start to
decline, uptake of CO~2~ by the land and ocean begins to weaken (compare
land and ocean CO~2~ fluxes in panels a and b of Figure 5.33; Tokarska
and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). During the first decades after
CO~2~ emissions become net negative, both the ocean and land carbon
sinks continue to take up CO~2~, albeit at a lower rate. For the land
carbon sink, the sink-to-source transition occurs decades to a century
after CO~2~ emissions become net negative (Figure 5.33c). The ocean
remains a sink of CO~2~ for centuries after emissions become net
negative (Figure 5.33c–e; Section 5.4.9; Figure 5.30). Whether the
transition to source occurs at all, the timing of the transition and the
magnitude of the CO~2~ source are determined by the magnitude of the
removal and the rate and amount of net CO~2~ emissions prior to
emissions becoming net negative (*medium confidence*) (Tokarska and
Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). For scenarios with large amounts
of CO~2~ removal, such as SSP5-3.4-overshoot, the land source is larger
than for SSP1-2.6 and the ocean also turns into a source (Section
5.4.10, Figure 5.30). While the qualitative response to scenarios with
net-negative emissions is largely robust across models, the timing of
the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO~2~ source vary
between models, particularly for the land sink. Due to *limited
agreement* between models, there is *low confidence* in the timing of
the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO~2~ source in
scenarios with net-negative CO~2~ emissions.

    removal from the atmosphere.** Shown are CO~2~ flux components from
    concentration-driven Earth system model simulations during different
    emission stages of SSP1–2.6 and its long-term extension. (a) Large
    net positive CO~2~ emissions, (b) small net positive CO~2~
    emissions, (c) – (d) net negative CO~2~ emissions, (e) net zero
    CO~2~ emissions. Positive flux components act to raise the
    atmospheric CO~2~ concentration, whereas negative components act to
    lower the CO~2~ concentration. Net CO~2~ emissions, land and ocean
    CO~2~ fluxes represent the multi-model mean and standard deviation
    (error bar) of four ESMs (CanESM5, UKESM1, CESM2-WACCM,
    IPSL-CM6a-LR) and one EMIC (UVic ESCM; Mengis et al., 2020). Net
    CO~2~ emissions are calculated from concentration-driven Earth
    system model simulations as the residual from the rate of increase
    in atmospheric CO~2~ and land and ocean CO~2~ fluxes. Fluxes are
    accumulated over each 50-year period and converted to concentration
    units (ppm). Further details on data sources and processing are
    available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

##### Removal effectiveness of CDR  {#removal-effectiveness-of-cdr .AR6Chap5Level451111}

It is well understood that land and ocean carbon fluxes are sensitive to
the level of atmospheric CO~2~ and climate change and differ under
varied future scenarios (Section 5.4). It is therefore important to
establish to what extent the removal effectiveness of CDR – here defined
as the fraction of total CO~2~ removed remaining out of the atmosphere –
is dependent on the scenario from which CDR is applied. Different
metrics have been proposed to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR
(Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al.,
2016). One is the airborne fraction (AF) of cumulative CO~2~ emissions,
defined in the same way as for positive emissions (i.e., as the fraction
of total CO~2~ emissions remaining in the atmosphere), with its use
extended to periods of declining and net negative CO~2~ emissions. This
metric, however, has not proven to be useful to quantify the removal
effectiveness of CDR in simulations where CDR is applied from a
trajectory of increasing atmospheric CO~2~ concentration. This is
because it measures the carbon cycle response to CDR as well as to the
prior atmospheric CO~2~ trajectory (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones
et al., 2016b). A more useful metric is the perturbation airborne
fraction (PAF; Jones et al., 2016b), which measures the AF of the
perturbation (in this case the CO~2~ removal) relative to a reference
scenario (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). The
advantage of this metric is that it isolates the response to a CO~2~
removal from the response to atmospheric CO~2~ prior to the point in
time the removal is applied. A disadvantage is that the PAF cannot be
calculated from a single model simulation, but requires a reference
simulation relative to which the effect of the CO~2~ removal can be
evaluated. When CDR is applied from an equilibrium state, the PAF and AF
are equivalent measures.

In scenario simulations and idealized simulations with instantaneous
CO~2~ removals applied from an equilibrium state, the removal
effectiveness of CDR is found to be slightly dependent on the rate and
amount of CDR (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b;
Zickfeld et al., 2021), and to be strongly dependent on the emission
scenario from which CDR is applied (Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et
al., 2021). The fraction of CO~2~ removed remaining out of the
atmosphere decreases slightly for larger removals and decreases strongly
when CDR is applied from a lower background atmospheric CO~2~
concentration (Figure 5.34), due to state dependencies and
climate-carbon cycle feedbacks that lead to a stronger overall response
to CO~2~ removal (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Based on the *high agreement*
between studies, we assess with *medium confidence* that the removal
effectiveness of CDR is only slightly dependent on the rate and
magnitude of removal and is smaller at lower background atmospheric
CO~2~ concentrations. Simulations with Earth models of intermediate
complexity (EMIC) with instantaneous CO~2~ removal from different
equilibrium initial states suggest that the smaller removal
effectiveness of CDR at lower background CO~2~ levels results in greater
cooling per unit CO~2~ removed (Zickfeld et al., 2021). However, there
is *low confidence* in the robustness of this result as climate
sensitivity has been shown to exhibit opposite state dependence in EMICs
and Earth system models (ESMs; Section 7.4.3.1).

##### Symmetry of carbon cycle response to positive and negative CO~2~ emissions  {#symmetry-of-carbon-cycle-response-to-positive-and-negative-co2-emissions .AR6Chap5Level451111}

It is commonly assumed that the climate-carbon cycle response to a
negative CO~2~ emission (i.e., removal from the atmosphere) is equal in
magnitude and opposite in sign to the response to a positive CO~2~
emission of equal magnitude – that is, symmetric. If the response were
symmetric, a positive CO~2~ emission could be offset by a negative
emission. This subsection assesses the symmetry in the coupled
climate-carbon cycle response in model simulations with positive and
negative CO~2~ emission pulses applied from a pre-industrial climate
state. Simulations with seven CMIP6 ESMs and the UVic Earth System
Climate Model (ESCM) of intermediate complexity suggest that the carbon
cycle response is asymmetric for pulse emissions/removals of ±100 PgC
(Figure 5.35). For all models, the fraction of CO~2~ remaining in the
atmosphere after an emission is larger than the fraction of CO~2~
remaining out of the atmosphere after a removal (by 4 ± 3%; mean ±
standard deviation). In other words, an emission of CO~2~ into the
atmosphere is more effective at raising atmospheric CO~2~ than an
equivalent CO~2~ removal is at lowering it. Sensitivity experiments with
the UVic ESCM suggest that the asymmetry increases for larger amounts of
emissions/removals and is insensitive to the background atmospheric
CO~2~ concentration from which the emissions/removals are applied
(Figure 5.35). This asymmetry in the atmospheric CO~2~ response
originates from asymmetries in the land and ocean carbon fluxes due to
non-linearities in the carbon cycle response to CO~2~ and temperature
(Section 5.4) (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Given *medium evidence* and *high
agreement*, there is *medium confidence* in the sign of the asymmetry of
the carbon cycle response to positive and negative CO~2~ emissions. The
sign of the symmetry of the temperature response differs between models,
with three out of seven examined ESMs showing a smaller temperature
response to a 100 PgC CO~2~ emission than to an equivalent CO~2~
removal. Therefore, there is *low confidence* in the sign of the
asymmetry of the temperature response to positive and negative CO~2~
emissions.

    .anchor}Effects of Specific CDR Methods on Biogeochemical Cycles and
    Climate

The AR5 WGI (Chapter 6) discussed the CDR methods, their implications
and unintended side effects on carbon cycle and climate, including their
time scales and potentials. Since then, three IPCC special reports (SR)
have been published. First, SR1.5 Chapter 4 (IPCC, 2018a) assessed the
potentials and current understanding, including the side effects, of
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS),
afforestation/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, biochar,
enhanced weathering, ocean alkalinization, DACCS and ocean
fertilization. Second, SRCCL Chapter 6 (IPCC, 2019a) assessed the
potentials, co-benefits and trade-offs of land-based mitigation options.
It assessed with *high confidence* that land-based CDR options do not
sequester carbon indefinitely, except for peatland restoration. Multiple
co-benefits were identified in the deployment of CDR options, many of
them with a potential to make positive contributions to sustainable
development, enhancement of ecosystem functions and services and other
societal goals. However, their potential was concluded to be context
specific, and limits were identified in their contribution to global
mitigation, such as competition for land. The third report, the Special
Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) Chapter
5 (IPCC, 2019b), assessed the potential of marine options for climate
change mitigation. It concluded that the feasibility of open ocean
fertilization and alkalinization approaches were negligible, due to
their inconclusive influence on ocean carbon storage on long time
scales, due to the unintended side effects on marine ecosystems, and the
associated governance challenges. The assessment of blue carbon
ecosystems concluded that they could contribute only minimally to
atmospheric CO~2~ reduction globally, but emphasized that the benefits
of protecting and restoring coastal blue carbon extend beyond climate
mitigation (SROCC Section 5.5.12).

##### Land-based biological CDR methods {#land-based-biological-cdr-methods .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Biological CDR methods, introduced in Table 5.9, seek to increase carbon
storage on land by enhancing net primary productivity and/or reducing
CO~2~ sources to the atmosphere.

Forest-based methods include afforestation, reforestation, and forest
management (Table 5.9). Building on previous work that emphasized the
global potentials of various options, more recent advances have focused
on the limits of those global potentials in light of ecological and
climate risks that can threaten the long-term permanence of carbon
stocks (Boysen et al., 2017b; Anderegg et al., 2020). Some of those
risks arise from droughts, fires, insect outbreaks, diseases, erosion,
and other disturbances (Thompson et al., 2009).

Sustainable forest management can help to manage some of these
vulnerabilities. However, in some cases, it can increase and maintain
forest sinks through harvest, transfer of carbon to wood products and
their use to store carbon and substitute emissions-intensive
construction materials (Churkina et al., 2020). Forest genomics
techniques can increase the success of both reforestation and
conservation initiatives, accelerating breeding for tree health and
productivity (Isabel et al., 2020).

In response to increasing risks to permanence of carbon stocks of some
types of afforestation practices and the competition for land, there has
been an increasing recognition that secondary forest regrowth and
restoration of degraded forests and non-forest ecosystems can play a
large role in carbon sequestration (*high confidence*). The rational for
this focus builds on their high carbon stocks and rates of sequestration
(Griscom et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2019; Maxwell et al., 2019; Pugh et
al., 2019), high resilience to disturbances (Dymond et al., 2014;
Messier et al., 2019), and more additional benefits such as enhanced
biodiversity (Strassburg et al., 2020).

The global sequestration potential of forestation varies substantially
depending on the scenario-assumptions of available land and of
background climate (AR6 WGIII, Section 7.5). Afforestation of native
grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands leads to the undesirable
loss of unique natural ecosystems with rich biodiversity, carbon storage
and other ecosystem services (Veldman et al., 2015; IBPES, 2018).
Comprehensive approaches to assess the effectiveness of land-based
carbon removal options need to be based on the whole carbon cycle,
covering carbon stocks and flows, and establishing the links between
human activities and their impacts on the biosphere and atmosphere
(Keith et al., 2021).

A range of mechanisms could enhance CO~2~ sequestration of forest-based
methods under future scenarios, including CO~2~ fertilization, soil
carbon enrichment due to enhanced litter input, or the northward shift
of the tree line in future climate projection (Bathiany et al., 2010;
Sonntag et al., 2015; Boysen et al., 2017b; Harper et al., 2018). There
is *low* *confidence* in the net direction of feedbacks of afforestation
on global mean temperature. The feedbacks are highly region dependent.
For instance, afforestation at high latitudes would decrease albedo and
increase local warming, while at low latitudes, the cooling effect of
enhanced evapotranspiration could exceed the warming effect due to
albedo decrease (Pearson et al., 2013; W. Zhang et al., 2013; Jia et
al., 2019, SRCCL, Section 2.6.1). Both afforestation and reforestation
affect the hydrological cycle through increased volatile organic
compound (VOC) emissions and cloud albedo (Teuling et al., 2017;
Kalliokoski et al., 2020), enhanced precipitation (Ellison et al., 2017)
and increased transpiration, with potential effects on runoff and,
especially in dry areas, on water supply (Figure 5.36 and Cross-Chapter
Box 5.1; Farley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017;
Teuling et al., 2019). Forest-based methods can either raise or lower
N~2~O emissions, depending on tree species, previous land use, soil type
and climatic factors (*low confidence*) (Figure 5.36 and Supplementary
Materials, Table 5.SM.4; Benanti et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019;
McDaniel et al., 2019). Afforestation will decrease biodiversity if
native species are replaced by monocultures (*high* *confidence*), while
there is *medium confidence* that biodiversity is improved when forests
are introduced into land areas with degraded soils or intensive
monocultures, or where native species are re-introduced into managed
land (Figure 5.36, Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4; Hua et al.,
2016; Williamson and Bodle, 2016; P. Smith et al., 2018; Holl and
Brancalion, 2020).

Soil carbon losses from human agriculture accounted for about 116 PgC in
the last 12,000 years (Section 5.2.1.2; Sanderman et al., 2017). With
best management practices, two-thirds of these losses may be
recoverable, setting a theoretical maximum of 77 PgC that can be
sequestered in soils. Methods to increase soil carbon content may be
applied to the restoration of marginal or degraded land (Paustian et
al., 2016; Smith, 2016), but may also be used in traditional
agricultural lands. A simple practice is to increase the input of carbon
to the soil by selecting appropriate varieties or species with greater
root mass (Kell, 2011) or higher yields and net primary production (NPP)
(Burney et al., 2010). In addition, improved agricultural practices also
increase soil carbon content. These include using crop rotation cycles,
increasing the amount of crop residues, use of crop cover to prevent
periods of bare soil (Poeplau and Don, 2015; Griscom et al., 2017),
optimizing grazing (Henderson et al., 2015) and residue management
(Wilhelm et al., 2004), use of irrigation (Campos et al., 2020),
employment of low-tillage or no-tillage (W. Sun et al., 2020),
agroforestry, and cropland nutrient recycling, and avoiding grassland
conversion management (Paustian et al., 2016; Fargione et al., 2018).
With *medium confidence,* methods that seek soil carbon sequestration
will diminish nitrous oxide (N~2~O) emissions and nutrient leaching, and
improve soil fertility and biological activity (Figure 5.36; Tonitto et
al., 2006; Fornara et al., 2011; Paustian et al., 2016; Smith et al.,
2016; SRCCL, Section 2.6.1.3, IPCC, 2019a;). However, if improved soil
carbon sequestration practices involve higher fertilization rates, N~2~O
emissions would increase (Gu et al., 2017). Some soil carbon
sequestration methods, such as cover crops and crop diversity, can
increase biodiversity (*medium confidence*) (Paustian et al., 2016; P.
Smith et al., 2018).

Biochar is produced by burning biomass at high temperatures under anoxic
conditions (pyrolysis) and, when added to soils, can increase soil
carbon stocks and fertility for decades to centuries (Woolf et al.,
2010; Lehmann et al., 2015). Biochar application improves many soil
qualities and increases crop yield (*medium confidence*) (Ye et al.,
2020; SRCCL, Chapter 4.9.5), particularly in already degraded or
weathered soils (Woolf et al., 2010; Lorenz and Lal, 2014; Jeffery et
al., 2016), increases soil water holding capacity (*medium*
*confidence*) (Karhu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; B.M.C Fischer et
al., 2019; Verheijen et al., 2019) and evapotranspiration (*low
confidence*) (B.M.C. Fischer et al., 2019). The use of biochar reduces
nutrient losses (*low confidence*) (Woolf et al., 2010), enhances
fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency and improves the bioavailability of
phosphorus (Figure 5.36; Clough et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2016; Z. Liu
et al., 2017). Biochar addition may decrease methane (CH~4~) emissions
in inundated and acid soils such as rice fields (*low confidence*)
[]{#_Hlk74849723 .anchor}(Jeffery et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019; S.
Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). In non-inundated, neutral soils,
CH~4~ uptake from the atmosphere is suppressed after biochar application
(*low confidence*) (Jeffery et al., 2016), and soil N~2~O emissions
decline (*medium confidence*) (Cayuela et al., 2014; Kammann et al.,
2017). The potential risks of introducing harmful contaminants into the
soil environment are not well understood (Lorenz and Lal, 2014). With
*low confidence*, application of biochar can have co-benefits for soil
microbial biodiversity (P. Smith et al., 2018), while the potential
trade-offs for biodiversity are due to land requirements (Tisserant and
Cherubini, 2019).

Peatlands are less extensive than forests, croplands and grazing lands,
yet per unit area, they hold high carbon stocks (Griscom et al., 2017).
Peatland restoration relies on back-conversion or building of
high-carbon-density soils through flooding – that is, rewetting (Leifeld
et al., 2019). High water level and anoxic conditions are prerequisites
for restoring by returning drained and/or degraded peatlands back to
their natural state as CO~2~ sinks, but restoration also results in
enhanced CH~4~ emissions which are similar to or higher than the
pre-drainage fluxes (*high* *confidence*) (Koskinen et al., 2016; Wilson
et al., 2016a; Hemes et al., 2019; Renou-Wilson et al., 2019; Holl et
al., 2020). In a multi-decadal time frame, the reduction in CO~2~
emissions from rewetting more than compensates for the initial increase
in radiative forcing due to enhanced CH~4~ emissions (Günther et al.,
2020). Rewetting drained peatlands will decrease N~2~O emissions
(*medium confidence*) (Wilson et al., 2016b; H. Liu et al., 2020;
Tiemeyer et al., 2020). Restored wetlands and peatlands act as buffer
zones that provide infiltration and nutrient retention and offer
protection to water quality (Daneshvar et al., 2017; Lundin et al.,
2017), particularly in nutrient-loaded agricultural catchments. Peatland
restoration can also recover much of the original biodiversity (*medium
confidence*) (Meli et al., 2014; Smith et al. 2018).

The concept of BECCS rests on the premise that bioenergy production is
carbon neutral – that is, as much CO~2~ is sequestered when growing
biomass as feedstock is released by its combustion. If these emissions
are also captured and stored, the net effect is removal of CO~2~ from
the atmosphere (Fuss et al., 2018). Sequestration potentials from BECCS
depend strongly on the feedstock, climate, and management practices
(Beringer et al., 2011; Kato and Yamagata, 2014; Heck et al., 2016;
Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017). If woody bioenergy plants
replace marginal land, net carbon uptake increases, enriching soil
carbon []{#_Hlk74850065 .anchor}(Don et al., 2012; Heck et al., 2016;
Boysen et al., 2017a, b). However, replacing carbon-rich ecosystems with
herbaceous bioenergy plants could deplete soil-carbon stocks and reduce
the additional sink capacity of standing forests (Don et al., 2012;
Harper et al., 2018). Furthermore, wood-based BECCS may not be carbon
negative in the first decades, initially emitting more CO~2~ than
sequestering (Sterman et al., 2018). BECCS has several trade-offs to
deal with, including possible threats to water supply and soil nutrient
deficiencies (*medium confidence*) (SRCCL Chapters 2 and 6, and
Cross-Chapter Box 5.1; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017; de
Coninck et al., 2018; Heck et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). Deployment
of BECCS at the scales envisioned by many 1.5°C–2.0°C mitigation
scenarios could threaten biodiversity and require large land areas,
competing with afforestation, reforestation and food security (Anderson
and Peters, 2016; P. Smith et al., 2018). Additional risks and side
effects are related to geologic carbon storage (Fuss et al., 2018; see
also Section 5.6.2.2.4).

In conclusion, land-based CDR methods that rely on enhanced net
biological uptake and storage of carbon, have a wide range of
biogeochemical and biophysical side effects. These side effects can
(directly or indirectly) strengthen or weaken the climate mitigation
effect of a given method, or affect water quality and quantity, food
supply and biodiversity (Figure 5.36). With the exception of weakened
ocean carbon sequestration, there is *low confidence* in the Earth
system feedbacks of these methods. Most methods are associated with a
range of biogeochemical and biophysical side effects and co-benefits and
trade-offs, but these are often highly dependent on local context,
management regime, prior land use, and scale (*high confidence*).
Highest co-benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore
natural ecosystems and improve soil carbon sequestration (Figure 5.36)
while highest trade-off possibilities (symmetry with the highest
co-benefits) occur for re/afforestation with monocultures and BECCS,
again with strong dependence on scale and context (*medium confidence*).

#####  Ocean-based biological CDR methods {#ocean-based-biological-cdr-methods .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Both ocean biological and physical processes drive the CO~2~ exchange
between the ocean and atmosphere. However, the ocean physical processes
that remove CO~2~ from the atmosphere, such as large-scale circulation,
cannot be feasibly altered, so ocean CDR methods focus on increasing the
productivity of ocean ecosystems, and subsequent sequestration of carbon
(GESAMP, 2019). There has been no change to the assessment of SROCC
(Section 5.5.1): there is *low confidence* that nutrient addition to the
open ocean, either through artificial ocean upwelling or iron
fertilization, could contribute to climate mitigation, due to its
inconclusive effect on carbon sequestration and risks of adverse side
effects on marine ecosystems (Figure 5.36, Table 5.9; Supplementary
Materials Text 5.SM.3 and Table 5.SM.4; WGIII, Section 12.3; Gattuso et
al., 2018; Boyd and Vivian, 2019; Feng et al., 2020). In addition, ocean
fertilization is currently prohibited by the London Protocol (Dixon et
al., 2014; GESAMP, 2019).

Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems (sometimes referred to as
‘blue carbon’ – see Glossary) refers to the potential for increasing
carbon sequestration by plant growth and burial of organic carbon in the
soil of coastal wetlands (including salt marshes and mangroves) and
seagrass ecosystems. Wider usage of the term blue carbon occurs in the
literature, for example, including seaweeds (macroalgae), shelf sea
sediments and open ocean carbon exchanges. However, such systems are
less amenable to management, with many uncertainties relating to the
permanence of their carbon stores (Windham-Myers et al., 2018; Lovelock
and Duarte, 2019; SROCC, Section 5.5.1.1).

Coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows store significant amounts of
carbon and are among the most productive ecosystems per unit area
(Griscom et al., 2017, 2020; Ortega et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2019).
These rates could be reduced in the future, since these habitats are
vulnerable to changing conditions, such as temperature, salinity,
sediment supply, storm severity and continued coastal development
(NASEM, 2019; Bindoff et al., 2019). These ecosystems are under threat
from anthropogenic conversion and degradation and are being lost at
rates between 0.7% and 7% per annum with consequent CO~2~ emissions
(e.g., Atwood et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2017; Hamilton and Friess,
2018; Sasmito et al., 2019). Although sea level rise might lead to
greater carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands (Rogers et al., 2019),
there is *high confidence* that the frequency and intensity of marine
heatwaves will increase (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1; Frölicher and
Laufkötter, 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020),which poses a more immediate
threat to the integrity of coastal carbon stocks (Smale et al., 2019).
Blue carbon restoration seeks to increase the rate of carbon
sequestration, although restoration may be challenging, because of
ongoing use of coastal land for human settlement, conversion to
agriculture and aquaculture, shoreline hardening and port development.

Biogeochemical factors affecting reliable quantification of the climatic
benefits of coastal vegetation include the variable production of CH~4~
and N~2~O by such ecosystems (Adams et al., 2012; Rosentreter et al.,
2018; Keller, 2019), uncertainties regarding the provenance of the
carbon that they accumulate (Macreadie et al., 2019), and the release of
CO~2~ by biogenic carbonate formation in seagrass ecosystems (Kennedy et
al., 2018). While coastal habitat restoration potentially provides
significant mitigation of national emissions for some countries
(Taillardat et al., 2018; Serrano et al., 2019), the global
sequestration potential of blue carbon approaches is &lt;0.02 PgC yr^–1^
(*medium confidence*) (Figure 5.36; SROCC, Section 5.5.1.2; Griscom et
al., 2017; Gattuso et al., 2018; NASEM, 2019).

##### Geochemical CDR methods {#geochemical-cdr-methods .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Enhanced weathering (EW) is based on naturally occurring weathering
processes of silicate and carbonate rocks, removing CO~2~ from the
atmosphere. Weathering is accelerated by spreading ground rocks on
soils, coasts or oceans. EW increases the alkalinity and pH of natural
waters, helps dampen ocean acidification and increases ocean carbon
uptake (Beerling et al., 2018). The dissolution of minerals stimulates
biological productivity of croplands (Hartmann et al., 2013; Beerling et
al., 2018), but can also liberate toxic trace metals (such as Ni, Cr,
Cu) into soil or water bodies (Keller et al., 2018a; Strefler et al.,
2018). EW can also contribute to freshwater salinization as a result of
increased salt inputs and cation exchange in watersheds, and so
adversely affecting drinking water quality (*low confidence*) (Kaushal
et al., 2018). With a *medium confidence*, amendment of soils with
minerals will have lower N~2~O emissions (Kantola et al., 2017;
Blanc-Betes et al., 2020) but will not have a marked effect on
evapotranspiration or albedo (Fuss et al., 2018; de Oliveira Garcia et
al., 2020). The mining of minerals can cause adverse impacts on
biodiversity, however, the use of waste materials such as concrete
demolition or steel slags for EW can reduce the need for mining
(Renforth, 2019). The spreading of minerals on land has a neutral impact
on biodiversity (P. Smith et al., 2018).

Ocean alkalinization, via the deposition of alkaline minerals (e.g.
olivine) or their dissociation products (e.g. quicklime) at the ocean
surface, can increase surface total alkalinity and thus increase CO~2~
uptake and storage (Glossary; Supplementary Material Text 5.SM.3; WGIII
Section 12.3; GESAMP, 2019; Keller, 2019). Ocean alkalinization
ameliorates surface ocean acidification (*high confidence*) (Hauck et
al., 2016; Tran et al., 2020), but there are also negative side effects
on the marine ecosystem, most of which are poorly understood or
quantified (Figure 5.36 and Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4; Bach
et al., 2019). Although ocean alkalinization could potentially sequester
large amounts of carbon (≥1 PgC yr^–1^; Figure 5.36; and Supplementary
Materials Table 5.SM.5) there is no new evidence to revisit the SROCC
(Section 5.5.1.2.4) conclusion that there is *low confidence* that ocean
alkalinization is a viable climate mitigation approach.

##### Chemical CDR methods {#chemical-cdr-methods .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Direct air carbon capture with carbon storage (DACCS) is a combination
of two techniques, direct capture of CO~2~ from ambient air (DAC) and
carbon storage. DAC entails contacting the air, capturing the CO~2~ on a
liquid solvent or solid sorbent, and regenerating the solvent or
sorbent. Different DAC methods have been proposed, which differ by the
chemical process used to capture the CO~2~ and to recover it from the
sorbent or solvent (NASEM, 2019). The captured CO~2~ may be either
stored geologically as a high-pressure gas or sequestered by a mineral
carbonation process. Storage is potentially permanent in both
pressurised gas and mineral form (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS has
significant requirements of energy and, (depending on the type of
technology), water and materials (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019).
Compared to other CDR methods, it has a small land footprint (Smith et
al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Side effects of DACCS include CO~2~-depleted
air leaving the air contactor, which could have adverse effects on crop
and ecosystem productivity, and VOC emissions (NASEM, 2019). Additional
risks and side effects are related to the high pressure at which CO~2~
is stored in geologic formations (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS is assessed
in detail in WGIII Section 12.3.

##### Methane removal {#methane-removal .AR6Chap5Level451111}

Proposals to remove CH~4~ from the atmosphere are emerging (de Richter
et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2019). CH~4~ removal methods seek to
capture CH~4~ directly from ambient air, similarly to DACCS for CO~2~;
for example, using zeolite trapping, but instead of storing CH~4~,
chemically oxidizing it to CO~2~ (Jackson et al., 2019). Methane can be
also removed microbially by supporting naturally occurring processes,
such as by enhancing the soil microbial uptake through afforestation (J.
Wu et al., 2018) or by directing the venting air from a cow barn into
the soil bed of a nearby greenhouse, utilizing microbial CH~4~ oxidation
(Nisbet et al., 2020). Microbial CH~4~ oxidation could also be used for
removal of CH~4~ leaked from point sources by building biocatalytic
polymers which include methane-oxidizing enzymes (Blanchette et al.,
2016). Methane removal is, however, still in its infancy and the
available literature is insufficient for an assessment.

    (co-benefits) or adverse side effects (trade-offs) for water quality
    and quantity, food production and biodiversity. The details and

### Biogeochemical Responses to Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) {#biogeochemical-responses-to-solar-radiation-modification-srm .AR6Chap5Level2511}

This section assesses the possible consequences of solar radiation
modification (SRM) on the biosphere and global biogeochemical cycles.
The SRM options and the physical climate response to SRM is assessed in
detail in Section 4.6.3 and Table 4.6. Section 6.3.6 assesses the
potential effective radiative forcing of aerosol-based SRM options and
Section 8.6.3 assesses the abrupt water cycle changes in response to
initiation or termination of SRM. Most literature on the biogeochemical
responses to SRM focuses on stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), and
only a few studies have investigated the biogeochemical responses to
marine cloud brightening (MCB) and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT). At the
time of AR5, there were only a few studies on the biogeochemical
responses to SRM. The main assessment of AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) was
that SRM will not interfere with the direct biogeochemical effects of
increased CO~2~, such as ocean acidification and CO~2~ fertilization,
but could affect the carbon cycle through climate-carbon feedbacks.
Overall, AR5 concluded that the level of confidence on the effects of
SRM on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is *very low* (Ciais et
al., 2013). Since AR5, more modelling work has been conducted to examine
various aspects of the global biogeochemical cycle responses to SRM.

1.  []{#_Toc70535754 .anchor}Effects of SRM on the Carbon Cycle

Relative to a high-greenhouse gas (GHG) world without solar radiation
modification (SRM), SRM would affect the carbon cycles through changes
in sunlight, climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation, soil moisture,
ocean circulation), and atmospheric chemistry (e.g. ozone; Section
4.6.3.3; Cao, 2018). Net SRM effects on the carbon cycle, relative to a
world without SRM, depend on the change of individual factors, and
interactions among them.

SRM-mediated sunlight changes directly affect the carbon cycle. In
particular, SAI would reduce the sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface,
but also increase the fraction of sunlight that is diffuse. These
changes in the quantity and quality of the sunlight have opposing
effects on the photosynthesis of land plants. On their own, reductions
in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) will reduce photosynthesis.
However, diffuse light is more effective than direct light in accessing
the light-limited leaves within plant canopies, leading to the so-called
‘diffuse-radiation’ fertilization effect (Mercado et al., 2009). The
estimated balance between the negative impacts of reducing PAR and the
positive impacts of increasing diffuse fraction differ between models
(Kalidindi et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2016; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020) and
across different ecosystems. The change in the absolute amount of direct
and diffuse radiation could also depend on the height of the additional
sulphate aerosol layer in the stratosphere and the hygroscopic growth of
aerosols (Krishnamohan et al., 2019, 2020) .

SRM-mediated cooling also affects the terrestrial carbon cycle. Relative
to a high-GHG world without SRM, the simulated responses of net primary
production (NPP) to SRM differ widely between models, such that even the
sign of global mean change is uncertain (Glienke et al., 2015).
SRM-induced cooling would decrease NPP at high latitudes by reducing the
length of the growing season (Glienke et al., 2015). At low latitudes,
the NPP response to SRM-induced cooling is sensitive to the effect of
nitrogen limitation []{#_Hlk52648289 .anchor}(Duan et al., 2020; Glienke
et al., 2015). SRM-induced cooling tends to increase NPP in models
without the nitrogen cycle because of reduced heat stress. However, in
models including the nitrogen cycle, this is counteracted by reductions
in NPP because of reductions in nitrogen mineralization and nitrogen
availability []{#_Hlk52484235 .anchor}(Glienke et al., 2015).
SRM-induced changes in the hydrological cycle (Section 8.6.3), including
changes in evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture, also
pose strong constraints on the vegetation response []{#_Hlk52564625
.anchor}(Dagon and Schrag, 2019). For the same amount of global mean
cooling, different SRM options, such as SAI, MCB, and CCT, would have
different effects on gross primary production (GPP) and NPP because of
different spatial patterns of temperature available sunlight, and
hydrological cycle changes (Section 4.6.3.3) (Duan et al., 2020).
Modelling studies show that SRM-induced cooling would reduce plant and
soil respiration (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et
al., 2018; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). Thus, despite the large uncertainty
in modelled NPP response, existing modelling studies consistently show
that, relative to a high-CO~2~ world without SRM, SRM would increase the
global land carbon sink (*high confidence*).

Based on available evidence, SRM with elevated CO~2~ would increase
global mean NPP and carbon storage on land relative to an unperturbed
climate, mainly because of CO~2~ fertilization of photosynthesis (*high
confidence*) (Glienke et al., 2015; Tjiputra et al., 2016; Dagon and
Schrag, 2019; Duan et al., 2020; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). However, the
amount of increase is uncertain as it depends on the extent to which
CO~2~ fertilization of land plants is limited by nutrient availability.

    year 2070. Anomalies are shown relative to RCP4.5 for the multimodel
    ensemble mean and for each of six ESMs over the 50-year period of

    termination of SO~2~ injection (right). Adapted from Plazzotta et
    al. (2019). Further details on data sources and processing are
    available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6).

**\[END FIGURE 5.37 HERE\] **

Relative to a high-CO~2~ world without SRM, SRM would also have
compensating effects on crop yields. SRM is expected to have a positive
impact on crop yields by diminishing heat stress (Pongratz et al.,
2012). However, reductions in light availability will produce a
counteracting reduction in crop yields, especially if the crop type does
not benefit appreciably from diffuse-light fertilization (Proctor et
al., 2018). The balance between these effects varies markedly across
crop types and regions, from projected increases in maize production in
China (Xia et al., 2014) to reductions in groundnut yields in parts of
India (Yang et al., 2016). Because of these diverging results from a
limited set of studies, there is overall *low confidence* in the effect
of SRM on crop yields.

Consistent with the AR5 assessment, there is *high confidence* that SRM
would not mitigate CO~2~-induced ocean acidification (Ciais et al.,
2013). Some studies even suggest an acceleration of deep-ocean
acidification as a result of ocean circulation change (Tjiputra et al.,
2016; Lauvset et al., 2017). There are large differences in the
simulated spatial pattern of ocean NPP change in response to SRM, which
depends strongly on the SRM method that is considered (Partanen et al.,
2016; Lauvset et al., 2017).

[]{#_Toc5716998 .anchor}

1.  []{#_Toc70535755 .anchor}Consequences of SRM and its Termination on
    Atmospheric CO~2~ Burden

Modelling studies consistently show that, relative to a high-CO~2~ world
without SRM, SRM-induced cooling (Section 4.6.3.3) would reduce plant
and soil respiration, and also reduce the negative effects of warming on
ocean carbon uptake (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and
Jiang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Muri et al., 2018; Sonntag et al.,
2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). A multi-model
study (Plazzotta et al., 2019) indicates that, relative to a high-CO~2~
concentration world without SRM, stratospheric sulphur dioxide (SO~2~)
injection increases the allowable CO~2~ emission by enhancing CO~2~
uptake by both land and ocean (Figure 5.37). As a result of enhanced
global carbon uptake, SRM would reduce the burden of atmospheric CO~2~
(*high confidence*). However, the amount of SRM-induced reduction in
atmospheric CO~2~ depends on the future emission scenario and modelled
oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, which differ widely between models
(Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et
al., 2018)[]{#_Hlk52650822 .anchor}. Models that include the terrestrial
nitrogen cycle usually report a much smaller reduction of atmospheric
CO~2~ in response to SRM than models without the nitrogen cycle, mainly
because nitrogen limitation leads to a weaker terrestrial carbon sink
(Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020).
Large-scale application of SAI is found to reduce the rate of release of
CO~2~ and CH~4~ from permafrost thaw (Lee et al., 2019; Chen et al.,
2020).

A hypothetical, sudden and sustained termination of SRM would cause a
rapid increase in global warming that poses great risks to biodiversity
(A. Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 2014; Trisos et al., 2018)
(Section 4.6.3.3). It would also weaken carbon sinks, accelerating
atmospheric CO~2~ accumulation and inducing further warming (Figure
5.37; Matthews and Caldeira, 2007; Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al.,
2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019). However, a scenario with gradual
phase-out of SRM under emission reduction could reduce the large
negative effect of sudden SRM termination (MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith
and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016), []{#_Hlk52687336
.anchor}though this would be limited by how rapidly emissions reductions
can be scaled-up (Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016).

1.  []{#_Toc70535756 .anchor}Consequences of SRM on other Biogeochemical
    Cycles

SAI is found to reduce global average surface ozone concentration (Xia
et al., 2017) mainly as a result of aerosol-induced reduction in
stratospheric ozone at polar regions, resulting in reduced transport of
ozone from the stratosphere (Pitari et al., 2014; Tilmes et al., 2018).
The reduction in surface ozone, together with alteration to ultraviolet
(UV) radiation, would have important implications for vegetation
response (Xia et al., 2017). A modelling study shows that sea salt
aerosol injection for MCB would reduce hydroxyl (OH) concentration and
increase CH~4~ lifetime, and hence, have potential implications for
surface ozone pollution (Horowitz et al., 2020). It has also been
reported that the use of SAI to limit global mean warming from 2°C to
1.5°C would reduce fire weather in many areas (Burton et al., 2018).

1.  []{#_Toc70535757 .anchor}Synthesis of Biogeochemical Responses to
    SRM

SRM would alter the global carbon cycle through SRM-induced climate
effect, such as changes in sunlight, temperature, precipitation, and
ocean circulation. Compared to a high-CO~2~ world without SRM, SRM would
enhance the net uptake of CO~2~ by the terrestrial biosphere and ocean,
thus acting to reduce atmospheric CO~2~ (*high confidence*). SRM would
also affect surface ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry. Due
to complex interplays between SRM-induced changes in direct and diffuse
sunlight, temperature, the coupling of water-carbon-nitrogen cycles, and
atmospheric chemistry, there is *large uncertainty* in the overall
response of the terrestrial biosphere response to SRM. Thus, the level
of *confidence* on the effect of SRM on carbon and other biogeochemical
cycles is *low*.

Final Remarks {#final-remarks .AR6Chap5Level151}
-------------

Key research developments to further strengthen the confidence levels in
AR7 include the following:

***Contemporary Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) Trends and Attribution***

-   Further constrain the CO~2~, CH~4~ and N~2~O fluxes from land use,
    land-use change and forestry (including gross fluxes), and fossil
    fuels. Improving spatial resolution and representations of land
    management, such as forestry, grazing and cropping.

-   Improve representation of the variability and trends in the
    transport of carbon through the land–ocean continuum, which has
    implications for partitioning of the land and ocean CO~2~ sinks.

-   Improve understanding of the controls over the airborne franction
    and sinks rates, their trends, and future dynamics.

-   Fill gaps in space and time for ocean CO~2~ and ancillary physical
    and biogeochemical observations at the ocean surface and interior to
    reduce the biases and uncertainties in the variability and trends
    for air-sea fluxes and inventory changes, particularly for the
    Arctic and the Southern Ocean.

-   Reduce uncertainties in wetland CH~4~ emissions, which are the
    largest source term in the global CH~4~ budget and proportionally
    have the largest uncertainty, to better understand future
    CH~4~-climate feedbacks.

-   Reduce uncertainties in atmospheric transport models used to
    estimate regional sources and sinks of GHGs as independent evidence
    from that of ground and inventory estimates.

***Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation***

-   Improve observations for the interplay between carbonate chemistry
    and a variety of biogeochemical and physical processes, including
    eutrophication and freshwater inflow in coastal zones to increase
    the robustness of future assessments of ocean acidification.

-   Improve our understanding of changes in water mass ventilation
    associated with climate change and variability to gain further
    insights into future trends in ocean acidification and deoxygenation
    in the ocean interior.

***Biogeochemical Feedbacks on Climate Change***

-   Improve understanding and representation in Earth system models
    (ESMs) of changes in land carbon storage and associated
    carbon–climate feedbacks including: better treatment of the CO~2~
    fertilization, nutrient-limitations, soil organic matter
    stabilization and turnover; land-use change; large-scale and
    fine-scale permafrost carbon; plant growth, mortality, and
    competition dynamics; plant hydraulics; and disturbance processes.

-   Improve observations and process understanding of CH~4~ and N~2~O
    source responses to climate, specifically from wetlands and
    permafrost thaw.

-   Improve observations and process understanding of ocean N~2~O source
    responses to oxygen loss and climate, particularly in the oxygen
    minimum zones of the tropical oceans and eastern boundary upwelling
    regions.

-   Improve understanding of the sensitivity of ocean carbon–climate
    feedbacks to physical processes that are not yet resolved by the
    ocean domain in ESMs.

-   Improve understanding of the processes affecting the efficiency,
    climate sensitivity and emerging feedbacks in the ocean carbon cycle
    via the biological carbon pump to constrain future global ocean
    feedbacks.

***Remaining Carbon Budget to Climate Stabilization***

-   Improve understanding of the sign and magnitude of a possible zero
    emissions commitment (ZEC). The ZEC affects estimates of carbon
    budgets derived from the transient climate response to cumulative
    emissions of CO~2~ (TCRE), but not TCRE itself. ZEC is particularly
    relevant once global CO~2~ emissions decline towards net zero.

-   Better constraint of the airborne fraction to reduce the spread in
    TCRE assessment.

-   Account for time scales of Earth system feedbacks over time for
    increased accuracy of mitigation needs once global CO~2~ emissions
    reach near-zero levels.

***Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Modification***
***(SRM) ***

-   Run large-scale and long-term experiments and assessments to
    explore: the regional feasibility of CDR methods; whether they
    present a verifiable negative regional carbon balance; and if they
    result in adverse unintended consequences.

-   Improve understanding of the effectiveness of CDR methods to lower
    atmospheric CO~2~ and reduce warming, taking into account Earth
    system feedbacks.

[[]{#_Toc33564341 .anchor}]{#_Toc5717001 .anchor}

1.  []{#_Toc70535760 .anchor}Is the natural removal of carbon from the
    atmosphere weakening?

*For decades, about half of the carbon dioxide (CO~2~) that human
activities have emitted to the atmosphere has been taken up by natural
carbon sinks in vegetation, soils and oceans. These natural sinks of
CO~2~ have thus roughly halved the rate at which atmospheric CO~2~
concentrations have increased, and therefore slowed down global
warming~.~ However, observations show that the processes underlying this
uptake are beginning to respond to increasing CO~2~ in the atmosphere
and climate change in a way that will weaken nature’s capacity to take
up CO~2~ in the future. Understanding of the magnitude of this change is
essential for projecting how the climate system will respond to future
emissions and emission reduction* *efforts. *

Direct observations of CO~2~ concentrations in the atmosphere, which
began in 1958, show that the atmosphere has only retained roughly half
of the CO~2~ emitted by human activities, due to the combustion of
fossil fuels and land-use change such as deforestation (FAQ 5.1, Figure
1). Natural carbon cycle processes on land and in the oceans have taken
up the remainder of these emissions. These land and ocean removals or
‘sinks’ have grown largely in proportion to the increase in CO~2~
emissions, taking up 31% (land) and 23% (ocean) of the emissions in
2010–2019, respectively (FAQ 5.1, Figure 1). Therefore, the average
proportion of yearly CO~2~ emissions staying in the atmosphere has
remained roughly stable at 44 % over the last six decades, despite
continuously increasing CO~2~ emissions from human activities.

On land, it is mainly the vegetation that captures CO~2~ from the
atmosphere through *plant photosynthesis,* which ultimately accumulates
in vegetation and soils. As more CO~2~ accumulates in the atmosphere,
plant carbon capture increases through the *CO~2~ fertilization effect*
in regions where plant growth is not limited by, for instance, nutrient
availability. Climate change affects the processes responsible for the
uptake and release of CO~2~ on land in multiple ways. Land CO~2~ uptake
is generally increased by longer growing seasons due to global warming
in cold regions and by nitrogen deposition in nitrogen-limited regions.
Respiration by plants and soil organisms, natural disturbances such as
fires, and human activities such as deforestation all release CO~2~ back
into the atmosphere. The combined effect of climate change on these
processes is to weaken the future land sink. In particular, extreme
temperatures and droughts as well as permafrost thaw (see FAQ 5.2) tend
to reduce the land sink regionally.

In the ocean, several factors control how much CO~2~ is captured: the
difference in CO~2~ partial pressure between the atmosphere and the
surface ocean; wind speeds at the ocean surface; the chemical
composition of seawater (that is, its *buffering capacity*), which
affects how much CO~2~ can be taken up; and the use of CO~2~ in
photosynthesis by seawater microalgae. The CO~2~-enriched surface ocean
water is transported to the deep ocean in specific zones around the
globe (such as the Northern Atlantic and the Southern Ocean),
effectively storing the CO~2~ away from the atmosphere for many decades
to centuries. The combined effect of warmer surface ocean temperatures
on these processes is to weaken the future ocean CO~2~ sink. 

The ocean carbon sink is better quantified than the land sink, thanks to
direct ocean and atmospheric carbon observations. The land carbon sink
is more challenging to monitor globally, because it varies widely, even
regionally. There is currently no direct evidence that the natural sinks
are slowing down, because observable changes in the fraction of human
emissions stored on land or in oceans are small compared to year-to-year
and decadal variations of these sinks. Nevertheless, it is becoming more
obvious that atmospheric and climate changes are affecting the processes
controlling the land and ocean sinks.

Since the land and ocean sinks respond to the rise in atmospheric CO~2~
and to human-induced global warming, the absolute amount of CO~2~ taken
up by land and ocean will be affected by future CO~2~ emissions. This
also implies that, if countries manage to strongly reduce global CO~2~
emissions, or even remove CO~2~ from the atmosphere, these sinks will
take up less CO~2~ because of the reduced human perturbation of the
carbon cycle. Under future high-warming scenarios, it is expected that
the global ocean and land sinks will stop growing in the second half of
the century as climate change increasingly affects them. Thus, the total
amount of CO~2~ emitted to the atmosphere and the responses of the
natural CO~2~ sinks will both determine what efforts are required to
limit global warming to a certain level (see FAQ 5.4), underscoring how
important it is to understand the evolution of these natural CO~2~
sinks.

1.  []{#_Toc70535761 .anchor}Can thawing permafrost substantially
    increase global warming?

*In the Arctic, large amounts of organic carbon are stored in permafrost
– ground that remains frozen throughout the year. If significant areas
of permafrost thaw as the climate warms, some of that carbon may be
released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or methane,
resulting in additional warming. Projections from models of permafrost
ecosystems suggest that future permafrost thaw will lead to some
additional warming – enough to be important, but not enough to lead to a
‘runaway warming’ situation, where permafrost thaw leads to a dramatic,
self-reinforcing acceleration of global warming. *

The Arctic is the biggest climate-sensitive carbon pool on Earth,
storing twice as much carbon in its frozen soils, or *permafrost*, than
is currently stored in the atmosphere. As the Arctic region warms faster
than anywhere else on Earth, there are concerns that this warming could
release greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere and therefore
significantly amplify climate change.

The carbon in the permafrost has built up over thousands of years, as
dead plants have been buried and accumulated within layers of frozen
soil, where the cold prevents the organic material from decomposing. As
the Arctic warms and soils thaw, the organic matter in these soils
begins to decompose rapidly and return to the atmosphere as either
carbon dioxide (CO~2~) or methane (CH~4~), which are both important
GHGs. Permafrost can also thaw abruptly in a given place, due to melting
ice in the ground reshaping Arctic landscapes, lakes growing and
draining, and fires burning away insulating surface soil layers. Thawing
of permafrost carbon has already been observed in the Arctic, and
climate models project that much of the shallow permafrost (&lt;3 m
depth) throughout the Arctic would thaw under moderate to high amounts
of global warming (2°C–4°C).

While permafrost processes are complex, they are beginning to be
included in models that represent the interactions between the climate
and the carbon cycle. The projections from these permafrost carbon
models show a wide range in the estimated strength of a carbon–climate
vicious circle, from CO~2~and CH~4~, equivalent to 14–175 billion tonnes
of CO~2~ released per 1°C of global warming. By comparison, in 2019,
human activities have released about 40 billion tonnes of CO~2~ into the
atmosphere. This has two implications. First, the extra warming caused
by permafrost thawing is strong enough that it must be considered when
estimating the total amount of remaining emissions permitted to
stabilize the climate at a given level of global warming (i.e., the
remaining carbon budget, see FAQ 5.4). Second, the models do not
identify any one amount of warming at which permafrost thaw becomes a
‘tipping point’ or threshold in the climate system that would lead to a
runaway global warming. However, models do project that emissions would
continuously increase with warming, and that this trend could last for
hundreds of years.

Permafrost can also be found in other cold places (e.g., mountain
ranges), but those places contain much less carbon than in the Arctic.
For instance, the Tibetan plateau contains about 3% as much carbon as is
stored in the Arctic. There is also concern about carbon frozen in
shallow ocean sediments. These deposits are known as *methane hydrates*
or *clathrates*, which are CH~4~ molecules locked within a cage of ice
molecules. They formed as frozen soils that were flooded when sea levels
rose after the last ice age. If these hydrates thaw, they may release
CH~4~ that can bubble up to the surface. The total amount of carbon in
permafrost-associated methane hydrates is much less than the carbon in
permafrost soils. Global warming takes millennia to penetrate into the
sediments beneath the ocean, which is why these hydrates are still
responding to the last deglaciation. As a result, only a small fraction
of the existing hydrates could be destabilized during the coming
century. Even when CH~4~ is released from hydrates, most of it is
expected to be consumed and oxidised into CO~2~ in the ocean before
reaching the atmosphere. The most complete modelling of these processes
to date suggests a release to the atmosphere at a rate of less than 2%
of current human-induced CH~4~ emissions.

Overall, thawing permafrost in the Arctic appears to be an important
additional source of heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, more so than
undersea hydrates. Climate and carbon cycle models are beginning to
consider permafrost processes. While these models disagree on the exact
amount of the heat-trapping gases that will be released into the
atmosphere, they agree that: (i) the amount of such gases released from
permafrost will increase with the amount of global warming; and (ii) the
warming effect of thawing permafrost is significant enough to be
considered in estimates of the remaining carbon budgets for limiting
future warming.

    .anchor}Could climate change be reversed by removing carbon dioxide
    from the atmosphere?

*Deliberate removal of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) from the atmosphere*
c*ould reverse (i.e. change the direction of) some aspects of climate
change. However, this will only happen if it results in a net reduction
in the total amount of CO~2~ in the atmosphere, that is, if deliberate
removals are larger than emissions. Some climate change trends, such as
the increase in global surface temperature, would start to reverse
within a few years. Other aspects of climate change would take decades
(e.g., permafrost thawing) or centuries (e.g., acidification of the deep
ocean) to reverse, and some, such as sea level rise, would take
centuries to millennia to change direction. *

The term *negative* *CO~2~ emissions* refers to the removal of CO~2~
from the atmosphere by deliberate human activities, in addition to
removals that occur naturally, and is often used as synonymous with
*carbon dioxide removal*. Negative CO~2~ emissions can compensate for
the release of CO~2~ into the atmosphere by human activities. They could
be achieved by strengthening natural CO~2~ sequestration processes on
land (e.g., by planting trees or through agricultural practices that
increase the carbon content of soils) and/or in the ocean (e.g., by
restoration of coastal ecosystems) or by removing CO~2~ directly from
the atmosphere. If CO~2~ removals are greater than human-caused CO~2~
emissions globally, emissions are said to be *net* *negative*. It should
be noted that CO~2~ removal technologies are unable, or not yet ready,
to achieve the scale of removal that would be required to compensate for
current levels of emissions, and most have undesired side effects.

In the absence of deliberate CO~2~ removal, the CO~2~ concentration in
the atmosphere (a measure of the amount of CO~2~ in the atmosphere)
results from a balance between human-caused CO~2~ release and the
removal of CO~2~ by natural processes on land and in the ocean (natural
‘carbon sinks’; see FAQ 5.1). If CO~2~ release exceeds removal by carbon
sinks, the CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere would increase; if
CO~2~ release equals removal, the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration would
stabilize; and if CO~2~ removal exceeds release, the CO~2~ concentration
would decline. This applies in the same way to *net* CO~2~ emissions –
that is, the sum of human-caused releases and deliberate removals.

If the CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere starts to go down, the
Earth’s climate would respond to this change (FAQ 5.3, Figure 1). Some
parts of the climate system take time to react to a change in CO~2~
concentration, so a decline in atmospheric CO~2~ as a result of net
negative emissions would not lead to immediate reversal of all climate
change trends. Recent studies have shown that global surface temperature
starts to decline within a few years following a decline in atmospheric
CO~2~, although the decline would not be detectable for decades due to
natural climate variability (see FAQ 4.2). Other consequences of
human-induced climate change, such as reduction in permafrost area,
would take decades; yet others, such as warming, acidification and
oxygen loss of the deep ocean, would take centuries to reverse following
a decline in the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration. Sea level would
continue to rise for many centuries to millennia, even if large
deliberate CO~2~ removals were successfully implemented.

‘Overshoot' scenarios are a class of future scenarios that are receiving
increasing attention, particularly in the context of ambitious climate
goals, such as the global warming limits of 1.5°C or 2°C included in the
Paris Agreement. In these scenarios, a slow rate of reductions in
emissions in the near term is compensated by net negative CO~2~
emissions in the later part of this century, which results in a
temporary breach or ‘overshoot’ of a given warming level. Due to the
delayed reaction of several climate system components, it follows that
the temporary overshoot would result in additional climate changes
compared to a scenario that reaches the goal without overshoot. These
changes would take decades to many centuries to reverse, with the
reversal taking longer for scenarios with larger overshoot.

Removing more CO~2~ from the atmosphere than is emitted into it would
indeed begin to reverse some aspects of climate change, but some changes
would still continue in their current direction for decades to
millennia. Approaches capable of large-scale removal of CO~2~ are still
in the state of research and development or unproven at the scales of
deployment necessary to achieve a net reduction in atmospheric CO~2~
levels. CO~2~ removal approaches, particularly those deployed on land,
can have undesired side effects on water, food production and
biodiversity.

**FAQ 5.3, Figure 1:** **Changes in aspects of climate change in
response to a peak and decline in the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration**
(top panel). The vertical grey dashed line indicates the time of peak
CO~2~ concentration in all panels. It is shown that the reversal of
global surface warming lags the decrease in the atmospheric CO~2~
concentration by a few years, the reversal of permafrost area decline
lags the decrease in atmospheric CO~2~ by decades, and ocean thermal
expansion continues for several centuries. Note that the quantitative
information in the figure (i.e., numbers on vertical axes) is not to be
emphasized as it results from simulations with just one model and will

1.  [[]{#_Toc70535763 .anchor}]{#_Toc5717004 .anchor}What are carbon
    budgets?

*There are several types of carbon budgets. Most often, the term refers
to the total net amount of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) that can still be
emitted by human activities while limiting global warming to a specified
level (e.g., 1.5ºC or 2ºC above pre-industrial levels). This is referred
to as the ‘remaining carbon budget’. Several choices and value
judgements have to be made before it can be unambiguously estimated.
When the remaining carbon budget is combined with all past CO~2~
emissions to date, a ‘total carbon budget’ compatible with a specific
global warming limit can also be defined. A third type of carbon budget
is the ‘historical carbon budget’, which is a scientific way to describe
all past and present sources and sinks of CO~2~.*

The term *remaining carbon budget* is used to describe the total net
amount of CO~2~ that human activities can still release into the
atmosphere while keeping global warming to a specified level, like 1.5°C
or 2°C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Emissions of CO~2~ from
human activities are the main cause of global warming. A remaining
carbon budget can be defined because of the specific way CO~2~ behaves
in the Earth system. That is, global warming is roughly linearly
proportional to the total net amount of CO~2~ emissions that are
released into the atmosphere by human activities – also referred to as
cumulative anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions. Other greenhouse gases (GHGs)
behave differently and have to be accounted for separately.

The concept of a remaining carbon budget implies that, to stabilize
global warming at any particular level, global emissions of CO~2~ need
to be reduced to net zero levels at some point. 'Net zero CO~2~
emissions' describes a situation where all the anthropogenic emissions
of CO~2~ are counterbalanced by deliberate anthropogenic removals so
that, on average, no CO~2~ is added or removed from the atmosphere by
human activities. Atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations in such a situation
would gradually decline to a long-term stable level as excess CO~2~ in
the atmosphere is taken up by ocean and land sinks (see FAQ 5.1). The
concept of a remaining carbon budget also means that, if CO~2~ emissions
reductions are delayed, deeper and faster reductions are needed later to
stay within the same budget. If the remaining carbon budget is exceeded,
this will result in either higher global warming or a need to actively
remove CO~2~ from the atmosphere to reduce global temperatures back down
to the desired level (see FAQ 5.3).

Estimating the size of remaining carbon budgets depends on a set of
choices. These choices include: (1) the global warming level that is
chosen as a limit (for example, 1.5°C or 2°C relative to pre-industrial
levels); (2) the probability with which we want to ensure that warming
is held below that limit (e.g., a one-in-two, two-in-three, or higher
chance); and (3) how successful we are in limiting emissions of other
GHGs that affect the climate, such as methane (CH~4~) or nitrous oxide
(N~2~O). These choices can be informed by science, but ultimately
represent subjective choices. Once these choices have been made, to
estimate the remaining carbon budget for a given temperature goal, we
can combine knowledge about: how much our planet has warmed already; the
amount of warming per cumulative tonne of CO~2~; and the amount of
warming that is still expected once global net CO~2~ emissions are
brought down to zero. For example, to limit global warming to 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels with either a one-in-two (50%) or
two-in-three (67%) chance, the remaining carbon budgets amount to 500
and 400 billion tonnes of CO~2,~ respectively, from 1 January 2020
onward (FAQ 5.4, Figure 1). Currently, human activities are emitting
around 40 billion tonnes of CO~2~ into the atmosphere in a single year.

The remaining carbon budget depends on how much the world has already
warmed to date. Past warming is caused by historical emissions, which
are estimated by looking at the []{#_Hlk53769510 .anchor}*historical
carbon budget* – a scientific way to describe all past and present
sources and sinks of CO~2~. It describes how the CO~2~ emissions from
human activities have redistributed across the various CO~2~ reservoirs
of the Earth system. These reservoirs are the ocean, the land
vegetation, and the atmosphere. The share of CO~2~ that is not taken up
by the ocean or the land, and that thus increases the concentration of
CO~2~ in the atmosphere, causes global warming. The historical carbon
budget tells us that, of the around 2560 billion tonnes of CO~2~ that
were released into the atmosphere by human activities between the years
1750 and 2019, about a quarter were absorbed by the ocean (causing ocean
acidification) and about a third by the land vegetation. About 45% of
these emissions remain in the atmosphere (see FAQ 5.1). Adding these
historical CO~2~ emissions to estimates of remaining carbon budgets
allows an estimate of the *total carbon budget* consistent with a
specific global warming level.

In summary, determining a remaining carbon budget – that is, how much
CO~2~ can be released into the atmosphere while stabilizing global
temperature below a chosen level – is well understood but relies on a
set of choices. However, it is clear that, for limiting warming below
1.5°C or 2°C, the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards is much
smaller than the total CO~2~ emissions released to date.

**\[START FAQ 5.4, FIGURE 1\] **

**FAQ 5.4, Figure 1:** **Various types of carbon budgets.** Historical
cumulative CO~2~ emissions determine to a large degree how much the
world has warmed to date, while the remaining carbon budget indicates
how much CO~2~ could still be emitted while keeping warming below
specific temperature thresholds. Several factors limit the precision
with which the remaining carbon budget can be estimated, and estimates
therefore need to specify the probability with which they aim at
limiting warming to the intended target level (e.g., limiting warming to
1.5°C with a 67% probability).
